1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
i am recording on the computer i have

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,680
two backup recordings going this time

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,320
and i have optimized my podcast

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,120
recording situation for dog comfort

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,840
excellent because lucy is here

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,560
and she refused to sleep in her basket

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,800
instead she wants to sleep on my lap

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
while i'm recording the podcast

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,199
so i had to change the whole setup you

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,080
frequently change yourself

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,000
dogs come first

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,800
it feels like it has been a really

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,640
really long time

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,399
since we've recorded a show the way

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,000
we're recording a show today like

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
honestly like it feels like it wasn't

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
even the same show that used to do what

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,680
we're doing today i know exactly what

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,719
you're saying

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,360
it's like oh mike

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,879
i talked to him

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,559
a lifetime ago

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,120
it's it's amazing well okay we have that

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,559
which is like it just feels like it's

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,160
been forever since we recorded an

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,760
episode but i mean more that you're not

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,520
at home i'm

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,079
in a whole different country i'm in

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,040
america at my parents house am i a whole

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
new person because it feels like the

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,960
person i used to be

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,080
he only existed in one location he never

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
went anywhere but the person i am now

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,200
the whole world is available he can go

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,320
places

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,080
he can see things

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,119
he can do things what a what a novel

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,159
concept

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,119
the previous person doing things no

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,560
there was there was no doing things

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,439
there was

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
staying at home

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,680
so yeah it it does feel like

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
wow it sure has been a real thing since

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
the last time we spoke to each other so

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
in our last episode we were wondering if

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,280
you were going to be able to make

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,159
your various trips and it seems like

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,520
that you

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,200
obviously have done it because you are

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,680
in america now you're with your parents

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,640
uh how was your travel experience

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,399
yeah it's it's one of these funny things

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,280
where

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
uh i know that

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,799
previous me was quite concerned

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,320
i don't i don't i

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,640
i think we talked about like betting on

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
if i was going to be able to do all of

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,399
my travel plans successfully and i think

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,000
i gave it like 50 50 odds i don't

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,280
remember because you were adding the

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,959
complexity in right because you were

64
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,879
going from home and then you're going

65
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,160
somewhere in europe and then you're

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,000
going back home again and then to

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
america did you end up doing that by the

68
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,440
way because i remember there was a

69
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,120
conversation of whether you would just

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
leave from location one did you go home

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,239
again and leave yeah so the plan was

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,200
from to go from london to switzerland

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,280
and then from switzerland to north

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
carolina

75
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
but i was very concerned that travel

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,599
complexities wouldn't allow that to

77
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,480
happen

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,640
but from current me's perspective it's a

79
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
little bit like oh what was that guy

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
worried about nothing was a problem like

81
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,400
ev everything was really easy and it's

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,280
like okay it's travel the way travel is

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,000
the way i remember travel there's just

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,239
one additional piece of paper that you

85
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,200
need to get and that's your coveted test

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
results and i had my test done they both

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
came through just fine and

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,879
at heathrow airport they were very

89
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
concerned to look and check and scan the

90
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,159
piece of paper and then they let me

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,239
through and it was totally fine and at

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,280
zurich airport literally no one ever

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
looked at the test results i never

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,239
showed that document to anyone and i

95
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,120
just flew to america so

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
uh no problems whatsoever on the flying

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,799
front oh so you did go from zurich to

98
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,120
north carolina that was the final plan

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,200
okay that did happen and the funny thing

100
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,799
was no one checked the paperwork i

101
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
almost felt like i wanted to show the

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,959
flight attendant on that flight like oh

103
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,280
look at me i have a test result nobody's

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,159
checked it i did it come on that's my

105
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,480
gold star i had all these extra plans

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,959
like i spent an extra day in switzerland

107
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,799
to make sure that i had enough time to

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,799
take the test and get the result but not

109
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,640
fly out on the same day to do it the

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,200
next day so like it was all for nothing

111
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,360
i didn't need to do any of that so the

112
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
travel could not have been smoother and

113
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,920
i was super surprised but now i just

114
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,760
feel like oh okay great so there's just

115
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
one more piece of paper for travel

116
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,760
travel is back on the menu great this is

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
the thing that you can do so uh yeah it

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,599
was perfectly smooth so you went

119
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
straight back into your old way so when

120
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,839
i when we traveled to romania a few

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,040
months ago

122
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
i noticed like as we were talking about

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
on the show right that i had lost some

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,160
of my like

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,880
traveling confidence because things were

126
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,600
more complicated but for you it feels

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,080
like you were just straight back into

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,880
old gray mode yeah i think it helped

129
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
that i had the two flights so on my

130
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,600
flight out to switzerland i was a bit

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,080
like oh my god everything like airports

132
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,479
are so big am i agoraphobic now i don't

133
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,479
know i did have that a little bit on the

134
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,120
way out but by the time i was on the way

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,880
back like you know it's a

136
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,360
shock surprise there's not many like

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,000
zurich to raleigh direct flights so i

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,919
had to take a couple flights to uh to

139
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,320
make it to north carolina but by that

140
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
point like

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
then i just felt totally normal it's

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,800
like okay i'm just on a plane for a

143
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
while this feels normal uh oh i have to

144
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
change at an airport and get on another

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
plane and it just feels totally normal

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
so yeah i think by flight two

147
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
it's like oh i got my travel mojo right

148
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,680
back and no problems whatsoever so yeah

149
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,440
i'm feeling great about it yeah i was

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,479
totally fine on the planes it was the

151
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,800
airports were complicated because like

152
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
there were more steps that we had to

153
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
to go through maybe that's gonna change

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,000
like we're hoping to take a vacation in

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
in like a month or so

156
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,479
and it will include similar to you like

157
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,639
a bunch of plane trips like it's not

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,320
just a simple like you could just get on

159
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
one get off and you're there and maybe

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,880
that will help kick me in a little bit i

161
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
really would like to not

162
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,639
have regressed

163
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
in that because i used to be such a

164
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
nervous traveler and i really just don't

165
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
don't want that i've not i tell you i

166
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,400
have not got my packing situation under

167
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
control like we take it a couple of like

168
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,039
little weekend breaks in the last month

169
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,080
or so

170
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,960
and

171
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,680
my packing situation is just it's a

172
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
nightmare and i'm not really sure what i

173
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,280
have to do to get that back under

174
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
control again i feel like i've forgotten

175
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,639
how to pack

176
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,319
i'm completely with you there i already

177
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,319
have i've been making a bunch of notes

178
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,400
on this trip of all of the things that i

179
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
forgot that i do need to bring so so

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,639
that part of it yes like that's still

181
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,919
more uncertain just because i'm out of

182
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,000
the habit but i feel like you and i have

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,759
both gone through the same process with

184
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,680
travel of like starting as very nervous

185
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
travelers then doing it a bunch and

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,759
feeling like okay now we're confident

187
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
haha business travelers and then falling

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,240
out of it during covid but i i expect

189
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
that you'll get back into it very

190
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,120
quickly as well like when you once you

191
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,240
do another complicated travel situation

192
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,639
you'll go oh okay this is this is fine

193
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,080
and then you can also start making all

194
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
the notes for the things that you need

195
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,880
you're like oh right

196
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,360
i need a time machine drive i need a

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,960
little external drive because i can't

198
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,520
have footage that i'm shooting in just

199
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
one location because one location is

200
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
none location but i just totally forgot

201
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
like oh yeah you need this this thing

202
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,560
with you so i have a bunch of those

203
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,080
little things we might talk about this

204
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
in a couple of months time but i i don't

205
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
plan to ever travel the same amount that

206
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
i used to oh a couple of months time

207
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
interesting okay in a couple of months

208
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,479
time what's in a couple of months time i

209
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,160
have no idea around the turn of the year

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
yeah

211
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,479
interesting and so i just don't plan to

212
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,800
to do that anymore i you know i will

213
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
still i expect travel more than i have

214
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,240
at certain points in my life but not to

215
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,400
the level of like 10 trips a year or

216
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,080
whatever it was that i was doing in like

217
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
2018 2019. well i look forward to

218
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
hearing much more about that

219
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,440
so this this trip these trips are mostly

220
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,560
like relaxation focused for you right

221
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
how has that been am i right in assuming

222
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
that that it's been it's been kind of

223
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,280
like get out of the usual flow take a

224
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
break in some ways kind of thing i don't

225
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,360
know they've been it's been a real mix i

226
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,919
wouldn't say it's a clear like one thing

227
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,039
or the other

228
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,120
at the start of the year i did say like

229
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
i'm going to see my parents and my

230
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,800
family before the end of the year like i

231
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,960
just don't care what happens and so that

232
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,680
was part of this trip it's like okay

233
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
it's september

234
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,599
like work if you're really gonna do this

235
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,599
you need to do this at some point so

236
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,440
that's part of what this was about but

237
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,479
part of it was also working and so one

238
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,639
of the things that i did is the reason

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,319
that i went to switzerland

240
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,039
is

241
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,880
that was actually a

242
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
writer's retreat thing that i was doing

243
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,000
with a couple of friends i know i know

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559
it sounds so fancy did you wear a beret

245
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,120
the whole time yes i wore a beret and i

246
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
was smoking a cigarette

247
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
i was looking into the mountains bonjour

248
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,040
everyone

249
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,839
yeah

250
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,000
i mean it was in the french-speaking

251
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
part of switzerland which was hilarious

252
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,399
good old french people always refusing

253
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,920
to speak english even when you know they

254
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,240
can understand you perfectly well

255
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
it's like oh they're always holding up

256
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
that stereotype i always think oh that's

257
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
not real that's just a thing people

258
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,440
think but no it's totally real but yeah

259
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,000
so it was it was great and it is a thing

260
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,480
that you know like i do work trips on my

261
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,200
own you know graduations where i'm just

262
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
doing it like a dedicated period of work

263
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,560
you know i've been lucky enough to be

264
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,320
invited to some of these things

265
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,760
with some people and this is one that a

266
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,279
couple of friends

267
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,320
had been

268
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
trying to arrange before the whole

269
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
pandemic started and then is one of

270
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
these things that we just kept pushing

271
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,839
back several months at a time for a year

272
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,959
and a half

273
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,120
until finally all of our schedules lined

274
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,640
up so that experience is a

275
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
really intense

276
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
working experience that's hard to

277
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
describe because i feel like even on my

278
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,600
own

279
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,320
when i do little gracations to just

280
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,560
write and i'm by myself

281
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
those experiences are often

282
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,600
very draining and like very focused

283
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
times

284
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,080
but when you

285
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,800
also have a few other people there who

286
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,519
are there to do the same thing

287
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,320
and you're also kind of checking in with

288
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,839
each other on the at the end of the day

289
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,240
of like hey what did everybody get up to

290
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,519
it is

291
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,560
really intensive it's a really focused

292
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
amount of work and it was a great

293
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,839
experience to one be able to travel to a

294
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,200
different place

295
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,360
to be able to see some friends who have

296
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,279
been trying to meet up with for a long

297
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,320
time

298
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
and then three be in an environment

299
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
where i have you know what i think of as

300
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,079
like colleagues and we're all there to

301
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,079
do the same thing which is get a lot of

302
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,560
writing done in a short period of time

303
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,680
and so it basically got an entire script

304
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,320
written in the i don't remember exactly

305
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
like

306
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,079
nine days i was there which is pretty

307
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,160
great but it was

308
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,600
very exhausting by the end of it like i

309
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,640
was

310
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
completely

311
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,720
tapped out just like no energy left

312
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560
can't do anything

313
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,279
just got on a plane and and flew to

314
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,839
america so uh yeah that was that was the

315
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,720
first part of the travel which was

316
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
very very work intensive like quite

317
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,360
easily one of the most intensive say 10

318
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,760
days of work that i'll do all year

319
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,000
partly because other people are there

320
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,279
and like we're checking in with each

321
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,880
other and we're all here to do the same

322
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,000
thing so it's very focused very intense

323
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
i have some questions about this uh

324
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,839
experience okay what are your questions

325
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,519
everybody's working on their own

326
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,760
projects yeah no one's working together

327
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,000
there isn't like a theme like uh over

328
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
like we're all gonna write a script

329
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,240
about such and such topic no no no

330
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,920
there's there's no theme okay there's no

331
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,320
structure to it no because also we're

332
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,600
not all the same

333
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
kinds of writers like we're writing

334
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,640
different sorts of things so it doesn't

335
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
make sense to say like oh we all have to

336
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,760
write a script because not everybody is

337
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,600
writing a script yeah so everybody has

338
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,880
their own stuff that they're working on

339
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,320
and there's there's just like a very

340
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,360
vague at the start of it oh okay

341
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,560
there's things we want to try to

342
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,519
accomplish and so for me it was i wanted

343
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,360
to try to take a script that was

344
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,480
basically

345
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
just barely started and bring it to

346
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
completion by the end and so i was able

347
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000
to do that and other people had their

348
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,279
own targets for things that they were

349
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,839
working on right and every day you're

350
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,839
like checking in with each other this is

351
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,920
how much i did today do you set like are

352
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
there targets set in the day like i want

353
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
to get this far through and then you

354
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
talk about if you did that or what does

355
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,360
that look like yeah some some people did

356
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
that some people had specific goals of

357
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,200
like oh i need to hit a particular word

358
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,279
count or oh i need to finish this

359
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
particular section i didn't do that

360
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,800
because i never find yeah i just don't

361
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,519
find the the scale of a day makes a lot

362
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,680
of sense for me the scale of like the

363
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,760
entire time i'm here makes much more

364
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,920
sense to me but so

365
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,079
yeah just basically the very loose

366
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,480
structure is everybody's working on

367
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
their own during the day you know maybe

368
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
we we get together for

369
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,680
fancy berets cigarette smoking breaks as

370
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,480
as we think about life in the mountains

371
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,399
right yes exactly

372
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,959
we

373
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,600
oh chase okay

374
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
and so then then the only rough

375
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,399
structure is

376
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,880
we have dinner together and talk about

377
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,639
what we were up to then that's that's

378
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,720
really the only set point yeah it's it's

379
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,360
just a useful environment because

380
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
you know in in many ways

381
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,440
the kind of job that i have it's it's a

382
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
very you're on your own kind of job you

383
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,079
know you're just

384
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,600
reading about stuff and then you're

385
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
trying to write things and summarize it

386
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,519
and it's like a very very solo job

387
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,160
and it is useful sometimes to be able to

388
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,360
bounce ideas off of colleagues

389
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
and it's particularly useful to be able

390
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,120
to bounce ideas off of

391
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
people who do similar work but maybe in

392
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
a slightly different way or a slightly

393
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,519
different field so you can get just a

394
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,519
different take on things so

395
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,040
it's it's a it's a very useful

396
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
experience and i always feel very lucky

397
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
when i get invited to one of these kinds

398
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,959
of things because it's um i've always

399
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,720
found it really beneficial

400
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
do you not like think about trying to

401
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
find a way to keep that as an ongoing

402
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,320
thing or do you think it can only work

403
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
in these short breaks in person for me

404
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,880
it only works in these short bursts

405
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,480
there's a lot of things that i find

406
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,680
effective

407
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,639
in much smaller doses that as ongoing

408
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,279
things i just don't find effective

409
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,600
probably like partly the novelty of the

410
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,199
trip helps

411
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,760
that yeah so i think novelty is a big

412
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,560
part of it i can convince my brain to be

413
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
super serious about it

414
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,959
in a really constrained amount of time

415
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,040
it's like okay we have to be working at

416
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
100

417
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,760
no jokesies

418
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
uh you know that that's also why like it

419
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,720
makes it more serious when you travel to

420
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,199
a different spot it's like no no i'm

421
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,519
very serious about this like i've taken

422
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,079
time to go someplace right why else

423
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,320
would i be here if i wasn't actually

424
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,480
getting the work done like if i wasn't

425
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,839
going to get the work done what was the

426
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,600
freaking point in making this trip yes

427
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,959
exactly

428
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,720
and like so i have i've i've tried at

429
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,000
various times these kinds of um and just

430
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,360
to be clear i'm not knocking this i'm

431
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,120
just saying it doesn't work for me the

432
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,959
sort of thing where you try to you know

433
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,760
on a much more regular basis say like oh

434
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,399
check in with people every other day or

435
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,639
every week about what you've been doing

436
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,320
and i i just find that i'm not able to

437
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,399
maintain it over a long period of time

438
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,279
and my brain starts to

439
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,639
i don't know just like not take it

440
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,600
seriously anymore and so it doesn't work

441
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,920
so yeah it does sound like oh shouldn't

442
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,000
you just do that all the time it's like

443
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
no it actually works so well precisely

444
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,199
because it doesn't happen all the time

445
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,959
yeah it's it's the same reason that it's

446
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,079
like oh i take the vacations i know not

447
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,000
recently but like you know on occasion i

448
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
take them to go do an intense period of

449
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,959
work

450
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,199
and it's always super productive because

451
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,759
my brain takes it really seriously

452
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,480
but

453
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,040
let's say i went somewhere new every

454
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
week to try to always just be writing

455
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,360
really intensely i think that wouldn't

456
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,600
last two weeks i think by week three i'd

457
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,160
go oh this is dumb it's quite reductive

458
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
right like it's like me just saying why

459
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,240
don't you just work hard every week

460
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,839
what's your problem like i understand

461
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,839
like i understand the

462
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,120
why the question is so is is is

463
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,519
on the face of it makes sense but in

464
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,920
actuality it's pretty silly right it's

465
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,839
like no i i don't like here's the thing

466
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,120
i don't think it's a silly question

467
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,040
because this is

468
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,880
part of

469
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,839
knowing about yourself and so

470
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,120
like it's quite interesting but like one

471
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
of the people i was with

472
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,959
he does do the thing where he has

473
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,600
someone to check in with him every day

474
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
about what he's working on and like he

475
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,160
finds that very effective yeah and this

476
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,920
is where you have to figure out like

477
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,720
what works for you i just find like that

478
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,880
doesn't work for me i become almost

479
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,039
weirdly resentful of like having to

480
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,280
check in with someone it feels like oh

481
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,760
am i in school is this homework

482
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,199
it's just like it completely doesn't

483
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,599
work you have to figure out what works

484
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,640
for you in your own life i think it's

485
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,240
this is also one of the reasons why it's

486
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
very useful um in these kinds of things

487
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,839
to talk to other people about like oh

488
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,359
how do you write how do you write and

489
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,199
you can sometimes pick up ideas and say

490
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,640
oh that's something interesting i never

491
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,280
thought of like i'll give that a try and

492
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,120
see if it works and if it does like it

493
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,559
becomes part of your routine and if it

494
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
doesn't it just doesn't it's an

495
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,080
interesting and valuable experience but

496
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,480
it's it's not something

497
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
you know it's not something i could do

498
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,280
every month i think

499
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120
i would either die from exhaustion or it

500
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
would just rapidly become completely

501
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,640
ineffective and my brain would just be

502
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,559
like we can't take it seriously

503
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,960
we're not here to work we're on vacation

504
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,840
in switzerland like no brain no

505
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,600
that's not what we're doing at all we

506
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,400
have to

507
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,039
we have to write scripts you know to pay

508
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
the bills to be able to do these writing

509
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,799
trips like you can't

510
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,480
you can't just wander off and think that

511
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,919
this is a vacation that's not what this

512
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,440
is at all so that's what would happen i

513
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,360
think if it was more regular yeah okay

514
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,400
that makes sense

515
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
so then from switzerland

516
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
we went out to north carolina was that

517
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,440
more of a is this been more of a

518
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
relaxing time

519
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,240
well

520
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
so here's what i would say happened

521
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,960
i don't know if you remember mike

522
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,559
constant talk of the swamp of

523
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,039
uncertainty that i was living in yep i

524
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,600
think in in some ways

525
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
it worked out great to be able to do

526
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,400
this writing trip with some friends

527
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,840
and in other ways it was a

528
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,080
terrible decision

529
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,280
because

530
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,240
after having the sharks project

531
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,679
followed by

532
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,520
the tiffany project

533
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,720
and then immediately going into the most

534
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,799
intense you know week 10 days of of work

535
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,360
that i've had in a year and a half

536
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,280
i really was just

537
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,440
you know i was like barely alive when i

538
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,160
got on that plane it was it was brutally

539
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
exhausting

540
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,679
oh it also doesn't help that the poem

541
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,520
video that i was working on

542
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
one of my main goals with that thing was

543
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,960
i was like oh i absolutely have to get

544
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
this done before i go on the writing

545
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,799
trip like i need to be completely done

546
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,200
with that project but guess what it

547
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,120
wasn't done like i didn't finish it in

548
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
time so the first few days i was there i

549
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,960
was really like

550
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,760
just

551
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
busting my butt trying to finish up the

552
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,559
last few details on that poem video

553
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,840
and get it done

554
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,320
and also i was like oh i need to film a

555
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
thing at the end and so some very uh

556
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,160
sharp-eyed viewers did notice that those

557
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,280
mountains are like oh those look like

558
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,799
swiss mountains and guess what viewers

559
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,480
you're exactly correct at the end like

560
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,080
those are mountains in switzerland that

561
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,160
that was funny for me because i watched

562
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,880
the

563
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,360
version without that at the end right

564
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
and

565
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,440
uh i

566
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
remember we were sitting down one day

567
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,280
and saying tweeting oh did you want to

568
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,600
watch the new gray video oh yeah let's

569
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,120
watch it so it's like i'll watch it

570
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,559
again and then that happened i was like

571
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,840
oh he didn't finish it in time

572
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,200
because i knew where you were i knew

573
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,840
where you were going and i kind of maybe

574
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
wasn't aware of the timelines and it was

575
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,679
just very funny to me it's like oh

576
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
you're still working on it yeah it was

577
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,080
it was really terrible there's like just

578
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,679
one of these combinations of like too

579
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,120
many things went wrong and also

580
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
that project like it would just take

581
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,360
hours and hours to render on my computer

582
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,679
and so like i just ran into these delays

583
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,080
of it it it lasted until the trip to

584
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
switzerland that video though did give

585
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,200
us like one of the great out of time

586
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
moments so in our episode out of time

587
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
you're like i don't know this video

588
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,400
feels like it's gonna be terrible

589
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,559
and it's got like 50 more views than the

590
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,280
video it's about which is fantastic yeah

591
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
that is still a little confusing to me

592
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,240
um that is a case where i was definitely

593
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,159
very wrong in my prediction of how that

594
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,760
video would do and so yeah because the

595
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,520
title i think the title will really help

596
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
someone dead ruin my life again i think

597
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,679
that tie it was really good like it's

598
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,679
just a good title yeah but don't say

599
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,919
that it makes me so sad yeah i know i

600
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,159
know i hate the title game on youtube

601
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,480
well we both do more texans know that we

602
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,280
both really hate that stuff but it's

603
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,440
it's just a genuinely good title i i

604
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
don't really feel like it's a clickbaity

605
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,240
title per se it's just a good title for

606
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
that video and it is it's very

607
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
representative of the content yeah i

608
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,440
don't think it's clickbait either

609
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,520
because it is representative but it's

610
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,080
still it does make me sad that oh if i

611
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,919
happen to have a worse title i'm fairly

612
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,600
certain my prediction of this video

613
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,520
won't do very very well would be more

614
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,159
accurate and that makes me really sad in

615
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,840
my heart but you know again if you

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,200
subscribe to more text you can listen to

617
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,799
me cry about how i don't like how you

618
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,000
have to have clever titles for your

619
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,919
videos um like a big baby get more

getmoretext.com

622
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,039
but yeah so that like this was part of

623
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,440
the problem is like i had

624
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,760
two nightmare projects in a row one of

625
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,799
which split into two videos the second

626
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,400
video ended up being what like i don't

627
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
know a half an hour almost it was like

628
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
forever long feature length is that how

629
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,880
i keep describing it

630
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,799
video

631
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,360
yeah it's a feature length video and

632
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,919
then also my only goal in life was i

633
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,919
have to finish this stupid poem video

634
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,919
before i go on this writer's retreat and

635
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,880
i completely failed and so then i was

636
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,159
like just rushing so hard to finish it

637
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,000
on the writer's retreat

638
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
and

639
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,600
you know mike this is a thing that just

640
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,200
never happens like when i finish a video

641
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,440
it is exhausting already so i normally

642
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
take a couple of days off like i just

643
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
have to but i'm in a situation where i'm

644
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
like no brain boom we gotta like hit the

645
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
ground running full speed tomorrow

646
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
because i've already lost a couple days

647
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,360
of this like only happens once in a

648
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,679
while trip that's super valuable so i

649
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,760
just went like straight into writing

650
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,559
another video which i never do

651
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,159
got to the end of the week i had

652
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,840
finished a script

653
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
and then like this so this is just to

654
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
like give the listeners an understanding

655
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,760
of like i really mean it that when i got

656
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,320
on that plane i was like a dead man

657
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,559
walking i was just

658
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,120
totally tapped out in a way that i

659
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,799
i i just kept thinking about it like i

660
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,440
think i haven't been that tapped out

661
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,400
since i had the worst year of my life

662
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
which was my last year as a teacher

663
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,760
um when i you know quit teaching to do

664
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,679
youtube full-time and like that year was

665
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,679
really brutal and i remember the same

666
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,440
thing like that summer

667
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,120
i was just so tapped out from trying to

668
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
manage my teaching job and also trying

669
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
to do enough videos to push the youtube

670
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,120
channel over the hill to so it could be

671
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,600
like a full-time position i'll never

672
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,720
forget that first summer after i quit my

673
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,159
teaching job and i'm like i'm gonna be a

674
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,960
full-time youtuber but also i've totally

675
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,200
killed myself to get in this position so

676
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,039
i just didn't do any work for a really

677
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,720
long time and i remember i happened to

678
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,360
meet up with vsauce that summer and he

679
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,840
asked me he goes like oh are you still

680
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
doing youtube or have you decided to

681
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,080
quit that i was like it was so crushing

682
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,159
because i'm like no i've literally just

683
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,320
decided that i'm doing it full-time

684
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,440
if you're retired i've only just started

685
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,679
yeah i've only just started but i like

686
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,600
i'm worried that i i

687
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
like broke something in my brain trying

688
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,279
to get to this position to be fair

689
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,039
though that i guess has ended up that

690
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,600
that interaction has set like a

691
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
an ongoing precedent throughout your

692
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,000
career right like yeah yeah does grace

693
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,840
stop making videos so you know like you

694
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,159
have these periods every year or two

695
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,799
does he is he done with that now

696
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,799
yes yeah so like that was definitely

697
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,400
foreshadowing of the shape of things to

698
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,279
come uh 100

699
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,039
but i just i just like i never forget

700
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,640
that and like every every time i see

701
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,159
vsauce i always think if i'm going like

702
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,720
how did you say it like no i just i'm

703
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,840
full time now actually thanks for asking

704
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,600
but yeah so like i've just been i was

705
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,960
thinking about that a bunch this summer

706
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,919
because i think that currently this is

707
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,240
the longest period of time

708
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,559
in which i have just

709
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,360
done nothing work-wise

710
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,919
since i i went full-time so like since

711
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,000
10 years ago i don't think i've had a

712
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,360
break this long

713
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,279
but it's also because for the same

714
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,200
reason like last time

715
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,919
i think i've just i had never been

716
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,000
so tapped out

717
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,880
from

718
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,640
several projects and then a really

719
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,520
intense working period previously and

720
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,960
here's the thing though

721
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,240
it's been great because when i i got to

722
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,480
north carolina i finally got to see my

723
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,640
my parents see my family

724
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,360
see lucy who's uh still sleeping on my

725
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,840
lap right now gently snoozing away

726
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,000
for the first few days i i had this

727
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,799
little feeling of like oh i should i

728
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,880
should get to work soon like i really

729
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,840
want to

730
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
i finished this video script i need to

731
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,840
you know now get this video actually

732
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,440
finished so i can have something up for

733
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
the month of october but i realized

734
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,200
quite quickly the way i've been thinking

735
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
about it is like i needed to give myself

736
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,600
a special dispensation

737
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,159
it's fine you haven't taken

738
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,799
a long amount of time off in a really

739
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,159
long time

740
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,120
you haven't seen your family in a really

741
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,960
long time

742
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,679
just go with it like just

743
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,760
decide right now this is always the key

744
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,640
with things decide right now

745
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,880
you're not going to feel guilty about

746
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,559
not doing work for a while just you know

747
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,320
it's okay you've given yourself a

748
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,120
special dispensation and as always like

749
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,200
eventually the time will come

750
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
when you're not completely tapped out

751
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,039
and you're recharged and you can get

752
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,960
back to work but in the meantime it's

753
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,279
like be with your family

754
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,760
pay a lot of attention to the dog like

755
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,840
do some interesting things

756
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,919
and you like you haven't traveled you

757
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,640
haven't been anywhere like just actually

758
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,080
enjoy it so it's been basically a really

759
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,440
glorious month to have after the

760
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,679
completely miserable swamp of

761
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,400
uncertainty and sharks and tiffany and

762
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,320
everything else so

763
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,520
i feel

764
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,840
i feel quite relieved that i made that

765
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,679
decision right at the start and haven't

766
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,600
just felt guilty it's like no you need

767
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,679
to do this every once in a while

768
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,480
and

769
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,640
if there's there's any time it's

770
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,360
legitimate to take a bunch of time off

771
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,919
it's when you're spending time with

772
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,919
family you haven't seen in like a year

773
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,360
and a half so

774
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,600
it's been great i've been very relaxed

775
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,840
as you know mike been just like taking

776
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,480
some walks behind my parents house is a

777
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
terrifying swamp

778
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,679
but it has a lovely little boardwalk and

779
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,679
so you can just like walk around and

780
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,000
relax and do nothing

781
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,200
and yeah spend time with my parents

782
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
help my mom out with a year and a half's

783
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,159
worth of tech questions that she has

784
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,240
built up as like a list of things to ask

785
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,399
me great that's what i'm going to do and

786
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,159

so you posted a picture on twitter of

833
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,039
what i can only assume is a vast

834
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,440
selection of magic the gathering cards

835
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,559
and i'm assuming a score thing 30 30 or

836
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,240
if that's not really sure what this

837
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,640
means can you explain

838
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,240
what all of this is

839
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,360
yeah so

840
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,600
one might wonder they go oh

841
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,440
you so you've just been like hanging out

842
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,600
with your parents for a month like what

843
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,080
can you possibly do and the first thing

844
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,320
is my mom always does build up a lot of

845
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,000
questions about the computer between my

846
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,039
visits and so she did have a literal

847
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,360
folder full of sticky notes of tech

848
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,960
questions that we needed to work through

849
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,399
but one of the other things that did

850
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,520
come up

851
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,559
is

852
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,080
my mom

853
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,960
expressed a little bit of interest in

854
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,480
learning how to play

855
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,200
magic the gathering so

856
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,159
she had seen my uh the stream that i did

857
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,640
on my channel and she had heard us

858
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,880
talk about the game on the show a few

859
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,440
episodes ago and she'd made some like

860
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
just little comments that made it sound

861
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,120
like oh she might be interested in

862
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,840
trying to learn how to play the game so

863
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,799
i

864
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,440
completely seized on this

865
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,600
and decided oh great i'm going to take

866
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
this on as a project i'm going to teach

867
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,600
my mom magic the gathering she seems

868
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,880
interested

869
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,200
i also think she will totally love it i

870
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,480
took a picture at the end because i

871
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,720
thought it was hilarious but before i

872
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
arrived in america i thought oh okay i'm

873
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,399
going to teach my mom this game i need

874
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,880
to order a bunch of cards oh but also if

875
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,480
i'm gonna teach her i need to we need

876
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,360
some dice to keep track of things oh and

877
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,679
also we do need to have a scoreboard

878
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,200
because that'll be easier than writing

879
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,799
numbers down and it like gives people

880
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,559
something to focus on so i started

881
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,559
ordering like a bunch of equipment and i

882
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,480
didn't quite realize until i actually

883
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,559
arrived in america how many little

884
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,120
amazon boxes full of magic stuff were

885
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,279
waiting for me on the other side but

886
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,360
anyway it was very fun like opening it

887
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,679
all up and getting out the cards and

888
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,600
it's been this interesting experience

889
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,880
because

890
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,159
the game

891
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,080
is incredibly

892
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,600
complicated and difficult to explain

893
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,840
i've had this interesting experience

894
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,080
over the last several weeks like

895
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,559
teaching my mom who by the way has

896
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,440
gotten

897
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,080
very into it like she is super into the

898
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,320
game now as i've completely expected she

899
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,200
would be

900
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,960
i'm sure it will surprise absolutely no

901
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,039
one to hear that

902
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,200
cgp grey's mom is also a very obsessive

903
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
kind of person who can really get

904
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
absorbed endlessly in the details of a

905
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,960
bunch of things

906
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,039
and so this is why i was looking at her

907
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,880
and going like oh you'll totally love

908
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
this like if i love this you'll love

909
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,480
this but so even though i haven't been

910
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,399
working in the sense of of writing a

911
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,080
script i feel like i've had this

912
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,799
incredible experience which is

913
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,480
trying to

914
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,159
explain

915
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,440
this incredibly complicated game

916
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,679
in a way to get someone else on board

917
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,679
and it's it's i keep thinking of this

918
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,760
phrase like it's been professionally

919
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,360
useful to me

920
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,480
because

921
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,799
when i make a video and i'm trying to

922
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,679
explain some idea whatever it is

923
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,760
one of the main things that happens as

924
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,200
you write a script where you're trying

925
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
to explain something

926
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
is you can make choices about

927
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,880
simplification like how are you going to

928
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
simplify an idea

929
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,640
for the listener when you research a

930
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,960
topic you end up knowing a ton about it

931
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,799
at least i think if you're doing a good

932
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,240
job making a video that's what you

933
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,840
should be doing you should have a deeper

934
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,440
understanding that is conveyed in the

935
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,679
actual video itself or whatever it is

936
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,519
you're explaining if you're teaching you

937
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,760
should understand the thing

938
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,000
a level or two deeper than the level at

939
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,600
which you're teaching it so that always

940
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,279
involves like simplification you have to

941
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,559
decide

942
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,799
what parts of complexity are you going

943
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,120
to skim over you know it's like that's

944
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,880
something that occurs in my my videos

945
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,080
all the time it's like i'm trying to

946
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
simplify something down

947
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,840
so that it it's understandable more

948
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,919
easily but the problem with magic the

949
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,039
gathering

950
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,600
is that the fact that it is exactly this

951
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,039
complicated is the whole thing that's

952
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,080
what the game is is like there's all of

953
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,640
these complications and so i can't

954
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,399
actually decide to say

955
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
oh we're going to ignore the difference

956
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,918
between this and that because the

957
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,599
difference between this and that is

958
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,440
critical and it matters and it will be

959
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,079
the reason why you win or lose or you go

960
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,239
oh i'm just going to ignore that this

961
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,440
thing exists but you can't because tons

962
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,520
of the cards will explicitly reference

963
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,119
this thing exists and so a person will

964
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,199
go what is that thing that exists

965
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,800
so i don't know it's i've just found it

966
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,000
like very interesting as a kind of

967
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,520
problem or like a practice exercise

968
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,918
in explaining something where you don't

969
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,599
have the option

970
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,399
to

971
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,280
simplify and the thing is really really

972
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,399
complex

973
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,719
and i've never had the experience as an

974
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,199
adult of trying to teach someone else

975
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,760
magic and i do just keep thinking it's

976
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,800
kind of a miracle that anyone learns to

977
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,920
play the game because you kind of need

978
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,160
someone to be like an evangelist and

979
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,079
tell you like okay listen this is going

980
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,200
to take two weeks this is unlike any

981
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,680
other board game you've ever come across

982
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,839
but i promise you it'll be worth it at

983
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,880
the end but it will never seem worth it

984
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,920
until three weeks from now where you've

985
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
not only like learned how to play it but

986
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,760
you've also been able to play it on your

987
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,680
own a bunch and start to get a feel for

988
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,040
it so hey trust me we're gonna go on a

989
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,440
three-week journey together and at the

990
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,320
end you'll love this thing comma

991
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,040
hopefully sign me up

992
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,520
[Laughter]

993
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
mike you're a very good friend of mine

994
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,440
i'm just gonna say right now there's no

995
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,320
game on earth that is less for you than

996
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,119
magic the gathering oh do not get me

997
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,240
wrong my friend i was being 10 000

998
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,720
sarcastic i i 100 already know this is

999
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,359
not for me i i tried i downloaded the

1000
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,760
video game version oh no and i just

1001
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,040
opened it and kind of closed it

1002
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,599
immediately i just can't just tell i

1003
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,680
don't know why you should be like no

1004
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,359
this isn't for me

1005
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,920
like just in general card games just

1006
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,079
like general card games like i i tend to

1007
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,760
just forget how to play them all the

1008
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
time i'm not very good with like uh

1009
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,359
board games like the remembering the

1010
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,880
rules of board games

1011
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,960
and it kind of just says like no i can

1012
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
see where this is going and

1013
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,079
me and this game are not going to get

1014
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,079
along very well no i don't think you

1015
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,920
wouldn't get along very well i feel like

1016
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,520
i endlessly talk about it but i also

1017
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,640
think it is a interesting problem space

1018
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,240
because one of the things that i

1019
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,079
realized like oh my god how do new

1020
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,640
players get into this it's so hard and i

1021
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,720
feel kind of lucky that oh i first

1022
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,960
learned this as a kid when it was a much

1023
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,280
simpler game it's like oh they've added

1024
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,680
complexity over time so when i jump back

1025
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,760
in i go yeah yeah but i know a bunch of

1026
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,280
this stuff like i remember the bones of

1027
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,440
it from when i was younger but jumping

1028
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,040
in now it's like oh my god there's so

1029
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,200
much to learn and again why it's so

1030
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,599
difficult to try to think about like oh

1031
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,599
how do i explain it how do i simplify

1032
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,480
things is because oh there's a ton of

1033
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,680
rules

1034
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,839
and literally every rule has an

1035
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,000
exception to it that's part of the point

1036
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,240
so you go okay all right this is very

1037
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,320
complicated right to start with

1038
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,960
but also there are tons of things that

1039
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,839
happen

1040
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,839
that like the way i've come to think

1041
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,440
about it is

1042
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,480
they're not

1043
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,520
in the game they're just a thing that

1044
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,160
happens because this card says it should

1045
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,680
happen now

1046
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,240
and it's like oh my god like how on

1047
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,560
earth do you explain this and the thing

1048
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,320
that's been quite interesting to me is i

1049
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,560
can't stop my brain

1050
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,040
from working out

1051
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,839
oh how would i try to change this to

1052
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,079
make this friendlier for new players and

1053
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,920
oh there's just a bunch of pattern

1054
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,119
matching that's taking place and

1055
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,640
there are ways that you could try to

1056
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,560
explain that so oh instead of having all

1057
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,320
of these things that can put players off

1058
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,359
like oh

1059
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,520
there's orcs and there's goblins and

1060
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,200
there's wizards and some people just

1061
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,960
don't like that kind of stuff it's like

1062
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,640
you could explain all of this just using

1063
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,119
shapes you could say oh this card it's a

1064
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,839
square and this card is a circle

1065
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,680
and that one's a triangle and you have

1066
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,599
another card that says

1067
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,480
remove all triangles from the board and

1068
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
like oh suddenly it's so much more

1069
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,839
understandable

1070
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,040
it's just like you're just matching

1071
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,400
patterns you're matching these different

1072
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,560
words that are going on but anyway it's

1073
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,240
also just made me think a lot about

1074
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,400
what makes games

1075
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,440
fun

1076
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,599
like like why why is it that a game can

1077
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,640
be fun

1078
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,160
and

1079
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,359
a big part of i think what some people

1080
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,359
find fun about games and i don't know if

1081
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,280
this is true for you

1082
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,480
is

1083
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
it's not so much the game itself that's

1084
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,160
fun it's the figuring out how to play

1085
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,880
the game part that's fun

1086
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,960
like at the beginning of the pandemic

1087
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,560
my wife and i we got the board game

1088
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,040
pandemic and we played it for a little

1089
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,920
while great idea

1090
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,240
i said great idea but i mean bad idea

1091
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,160
no it was great all right pandemic the

1092
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,400
board game no i've never i know i i've

1093
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,839
never played it now i think you might

1094
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,520
actually like pandemic it might be fun

1095
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,119
but so here's the thing it's like oh we

1096
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,440
played it but part of the fun for me is

1097
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,000
like learning how to play the game and i

1098
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,040
go oh okay but at a certain point i feel

1099
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,720
like i've kind of

1100
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,359
solved it it's like oh i know how to

1101
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,079
play this game i've gotten reasonably

1102
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,280
good at it

1103
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,480
and now

1104
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,240
suddenly the game just loses all

1105
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,520
interest and i just never want to play

1106
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,880
it again which is exactly what happened

1107
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,160
with pandemic

1108
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,440
and so my pitch for anyone listening is

1109
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,079
if you have this experience where you

1110
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,839
play games

1111
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,680
but then at some point when you feel

1112
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,640
like you've figured out how to play the

1113
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,920
game

1114
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
and then you just lose interest you

1115
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,119
actually don't really want to play it

1116
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,680
anymore once you know how to play it's

1117
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,320
like magic is for you

1118
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,560
and it's one of the reasons why i really

1119
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
wanted to pitch this to my mom of like

1120
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,480
oh she should totally get into this she

1121
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,720
would love it because i've seen her do

1122
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,400
this same thing her whole life where she

1123
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,160
learns how to play a game

1124
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,560
she kind of solves it and gets very good

1125
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,720
at it and then totally loses interest in

1126
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,680
it but what you're saying is with magic

1127
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,440
there's always something to learn yeah

1128
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,920
it's completely impossible to master and

1129
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,880
so

1130
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,560
like i taught my mom how to play

1131
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,640
settlers of catan a number of years ago

1132
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,760
and you know she used to play on the

1133
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,839
ipad and then i think she basically

1134
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,520
became like a world-class player and

1135
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,200
never lost and got just totally bored

1136
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,520
and was like oh okay i've solved katan

1137
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,200
there's nothing more here for me and she

1138
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,359
put it away and never played it again

1139
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,640
but the thing that makes magic different

1140
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,119
is that every three months they come out

1141
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,520
with new cards and the new cards change

1142
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,839
all of the rules and mix everything up

1143
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,440
and so like it's never ever done if the

1144
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,160
thing that you think is fun about a game

1145
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,400
is figuring out the game magic 100

1146
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,839
is for you

1147
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,119
but the flip side is oh my god is it the

1148
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,760
most complicated game in the world to

1149
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,319
explain to another person and to get

1150
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,880
another person into and to like get

1151
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
someone on board with

1152
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,440
so there's a funny way in which even

1153
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,920
when i haven't been working

1154
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,200
i can see that the part of my brain that

1155
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,359
does the thing which is my career in

1156
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,280
some ways which is

1157
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,000
explaining things how do you do it how

1158
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
do you make it better how would you want

1159
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,240
to change this language so that it's

1160
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,960
more comprehensible to a viewer like

1161
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,200
that part of my brain is

1162
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,960
on vacation

1163
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,319
but it's also had this interesting toy

1164
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,960
to like play around with while it's

1165
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,319
recharging

1166
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,480
and i'm very happy that i have

1167
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,400
successfully taught my mom how to play

1168
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,599
magic and she is successfully working

1169
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,760
her way up the ladder beating the new

1170
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,240
players now and she's super happy about

1171
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
it and it's one of those experiences

1172
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,480
where i see her in the morning and she's

1173
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,240
all bleary-eyed because she stayed up

1174
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,079
until two in the morning like playing

1175
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,079
game after game after game trying to you

1176
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,599
know beat people on the ladder and it's

1177
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,920
like oh fantastic mission accomplished

1178
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,240
do you consider it a good thing that you

1179
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,560
can't turn that part of your brain off

1180
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,079
what do you mean

1181
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,160
well does it not ever make you feel like

1182
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,720
you can't like just relax because your

1183
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,839
your brain's always looking for

1184
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,839
something to explain to someone well

1185
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,880
i mean yes and um

1186
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,400
here's the thing like

1187
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,359
i like to play games

1188
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,760
i've always played video games and you

1189
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,960
know now i'm just like magic is my life

1190
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,200
the reason that i like that activity is

1191
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,400
because

1192
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,760
it's like the only time that i do feel

1193
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,240
like my brain actually

1194
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,079
is relaxed

1195
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,560
so it's a different experience playing

1196
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,640
the game not trying to explain anything

1197
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,079
and i just mean this for any video game

1198
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,920
like it can be really absorbing like i'm

1199
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
playing factorio or minecraft or

1200
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
anything

1201
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,319
it's the only time it feels like my

1202
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,359
brain

1203
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,880
can just shut off entirely that's part

1204
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,480
of the reason that video games have

1205
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,160
always been part of my life and it's

1206
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,680
part of the reason why

1207
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,520
when i'm done with a video and i need to

1208
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,079
recharge it's like i'll just sit down

1209
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,359
and play a game for eight hours in a row

1210
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,520
and i will do nothing else and it's like

1211
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,240
it's completely quiet in my head and wow

1212
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,640
how relaxing it is so

1213
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,480
i use games

1214
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,880
to relax in that way it's like it's very

1215
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,480
hard to describe but it's just it's a

1216
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,400
way to be

1217
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,240
absorbed

1218
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,040
to be pleasantly concentrating on

1219
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,560
something but also in a way where it's

1220
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,000
just clear and straightforward and quiet

1221
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
but yeah in the rest of my life i do

1222
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,520
feel like my brain is always chitter

1223
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,359
chattering away about

1224
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,760
how to explain something or you know i

1225
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
feel like oh my brain is very curious

1226
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,359
what's this what's that what's that

1227
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,040
thing over there oh how does that work

1228
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,040
how does this go like that's always

1229
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,839
happening but i also don't think i would

1230
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,079
have the kind of youtube career that i

1231
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,160
currently have if i wasn't that sort of

1232
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,240
person so i wouldn't want my brain to be

1233
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,640
any different it's always gonna be that

1234
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
way you've just found a way to turn that

1235
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,119
into what makes you money too yeah well

1236
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,880
it's it's like you figure out what are

1237
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,319
you good at and figuring out how things

1238
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,680
work and then simplifying them down is

1239
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,960
something that i'm pretty good at and so

1240
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
obviously i didn't set out to do this on

1241
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,200
purpose but it's the sort of thing where

1242
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,119
you just see like oh

1243
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,839
where are the skills that you're good at

1244
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,040
useful

1245
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,960
yeah sure sometimes there are totally

1246
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,760
downsides to a brain that constantly is

1247
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,520
going like wait how does that work how

1248
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,200
does this work why do why is that the

1249
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,520
case when i'm talking to people i can it

1250
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,280
can definitely be a downside sometimes

1251
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
where i'm like oh where did you hear

1252
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,720
that how do you know that that's true

1253
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,640
why do you think that oh if that was

1254
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,319
true would that mean that this is true

1255
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,839
like that that kind of stuff can totally

1256
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,440
get me in trouble in conversations with

1257
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,640
actual people

1258
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,319
where i think sometimes people feel like

1259
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,000
i'm interrogating them but i don't

1260
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,760
really mean to i'm just trying to follow

1261
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,040
through some of the things that are

1262
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,960
being said yeah so there are totally

1263
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,839
downsides but yeah it's games for me are

1264
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,760
the way to turn that off and to actually

1265
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,800
relax

1266
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,240
but what i mean by this trip being

1267
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,599
really pleasant

1268
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,440
is i feel like i've had the best of both

1269
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,640
worlds that i have actually been able to

1270
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,960
relax and recharge for a big period of

1271
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,400
time

1272
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,040
and also the explainer part of my brain

1273
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,839
hasn't been completely inactive

1274
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,960
it's had a pleasant difficult puzzle to

1275
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,160
work on

1276
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,520
during that time which is also a like no

1277
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,920
stakes kind of puzzle of how would you

1278
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,520
explain explain this incredibly

1279
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,920
complicated thing and you're not allowed

1280
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,000
to simplify it because the complications

1281
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,359
are the whole point

1282
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,359
so that's what's been going on and it's

1283
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,599
been just a really fantastic month

1284
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,640
although

1285
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,040
i have just recently finally finally

1286
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,680
gotten back into actual work so again

1287
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,400
like this period of time is is now over

1288
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,520
well it's been great

1289
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,520
it is true actually i i told my parents

1290
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,160
i was like oh can you please leave the

1291
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,119
house while i'm recording because now i

1292
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,319
actually need to work today yes like if

1293
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,960
work is back mike is here

1294
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,040
contacts much

1295
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,319
dot com

1296
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,079
subtlety is back

1297
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,160
i think we've maybe decided this is a

1298
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,240
product that gets a once a year release

1299
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,160
i feel like that that works pretty well

1300
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,480
i know that people love the subtlety i

1301
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,960
always want more subtleties and sweaters

1302
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,480
because i wear them

1303
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,880
a lot i am surprised how much i wear my

1304
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,040
own subtleties yes i'm actually looking

1305
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,880
at my subtleties and going i need more

1306
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,119
of these so mike needs to bring him back

1307
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,560
this is one of those things where i

1308
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,599
think we had a good idea and it keeps

1309
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,440
working and i know people that i know

1310
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,200

1334
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,880
the shirt that i own that gets me the

1335
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,040
most comments of any shirt because

1336
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,800
people will literally tell me

1337
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,160
oh my god

1338
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,000
you're wearing a color like i've never

1339
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,760
seen you wear a color yeah i've never

1340
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,960
seen i didn't know even though you owned

1341
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,400
the red one i've never seen you in the

1342
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,000
red one i've seen you in the blue ones

1343
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,680
and the black ones yeah i like the red

1344
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,359
one but i'll tell you everyone who knows

1345
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,040
me they're shocked every time i wear the

1346
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,319
red but like ooh but i think it's a

1347
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,760
really nice red i quite like it but i'm

1348
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,800
also gonna add the green to my

1349
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,559
repertoire i really like the color green

1350
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,119
for this subtlety so

1351
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,640
i think at least for me anyway i'm gonna

1352
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,160
do the same thing i do every year which

1353
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,000
is i'm gonna buy a bunch and then i'm

1354
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,640
gonna go six months from now oh i don't

1355
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,480
think i actually quite bought enough i

1356
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,280

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,000

1424

up your opinion right now

1426
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,160
do i love my ipad mini so this is it's

1427
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,720
been out for like a month now so uh the

1428
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,280
iphone event apple unveiled an ipad mini

1429
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,040
which by and large is very styled around

1430
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,839
the kind of newer ipad aesthetic so like

1431
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,319
maybe closer to the ipad air has touch

1432
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,359
id full screen not no bezels but much

1433
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,760
thinner bezels now nice and thin in a

1434
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,680
few different color ways supports the

1435
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,920
apple pencil which is a thing that i

1436
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,839
think we spoke about on the show that we

1437
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,599
in the past that we thought would never

1438
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,599
happen i think somebody sent me a clip

1439
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,280
of that at some point over the last

1440
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,200
couple of weeks which is us believing

1441
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,640
that the apple pencil would never come

1442
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,960
to the ipad at this point just some time

1443
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,040
ago and yeah so we have a brand new

1444
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,599
design uh you have one right you did get

1445
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,000
one well okay so no

1446
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,640
i didn't get one my

1447
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,960
wife ordered one that was delivered here

1448
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,040
to my parents house and so the box was

1449
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,480
just sitting there

1450
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,119
and i had no intention of buying the

1451
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,280
ipad mini do you wanna know why mike why

1452
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,559
it's so tiny

1453
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,960
so teeny tiny like that screen

1454
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,119
it feels like the screen is

1455
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,640
barely bigger

1456
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,160
than the big phone

1457
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,839
well i don't think that's the case i

1458
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,000
mean in size like when you look at it

1459
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,599
like when they say like oh these are the

1460
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,200
sizes it's like oh sure that's not that

1461
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,800
much bigger but it is a big difference

1462
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,400
but for me it's not even so much the

1463
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,559
screen size even on the ipad mini you

1464
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,480
have ipad os so

1465
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,280
you're able to do more on that screen i

1466
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,000
had no intention of getting the mini but

1467
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,400
my mom did get a mini and so i saw her

1468
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
using it and i thought

1469
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,440
ooh

1470
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,119
that looks interesting

1471
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,319
and then

1472
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:42,240
somehow my wife's ipad box got opened

1473
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,079
and i installed my icloud settings i've

1474
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,960
tripped my iphone

1475
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,240
get up

1476
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,720
onto my wife's ipad mini you know just

1477
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,680
to like just try it out just to see

1478
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,000
you you know my actual critical test for

1479
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,359
the ipad mini was is it too small to

1480
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,400
play magic on the answer is no it's not

1481
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,839
too small to play magic on and so i

1482
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,280
may have been using my wife's ipad mini

1483
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,839
quite intensively for the past couple of

1484
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:14,720
weeks

1485
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,680
and i may certainly be ordering one for

1486
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,319
myself when i go back because

1487
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,920
i'm very surprised but i like it i like

1488
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,960
it quite a lot it seems extra ridiculous

1489
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,760
when i put it next to my giant ipad pro

1490
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,000
yeah but the thing that has been really

1491
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,480
interesting to me is realizing it's just

1492
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,760
a very nice notebook size

1493
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,079
like it's almost exactly the same

1494
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,640
pleasant size as our theme system

1495
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,559
journal yeah it's like what a great

1496
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,680
little size for a little companion ipad

1497
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,319
and yeah i've been surprised by how much

1498
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,640
i like it and i've been surprised by how

1499
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,040
much i find myself reaching for it over

1500
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,720
my giant ipad pro it's a real win as a

1501
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,720
product i absolutely loathe the volume

1502
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,960
button placement but other than that i

1503
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,680
have no complaints for that ipad mini at

1504
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,680
all like it's such a great little device

1505
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,280
yeah with that with the volume button

1506
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,960
thing i feel like they gave and took

1507
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,319
away at the same time right because it's

1508
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,240
weird because it's at the top but i

1509
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,240
don't know if you'd notice this but the

1510
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,079
up and down changes by device

1511
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,640
orientation yeah no i i i have noticed

1512
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,720
that but here's the one that kills me

1513
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,760
yeah okay here yeah great idea i have no

1514
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,960
problem with that

1515
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,559
i get why they did it it helps make the

1516
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,880
volume button placement less weird but

1517
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,920
now it bothers me that my big ipad

1518
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,680
doesn't work that way

1519
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,359
right it's like guys this is this is a

1520
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,520
software thing you should make all the

1521
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,640
volume buttons work this way

1522
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,480
makes sense that just because you moved

1523
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,240
it to the top now it doesn't make sense

1524
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,640
because the point is like the the the

1525
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,400
buttons are always fixed and doesn't

1526
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,000
matter where they are if you change

1527
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,640
where the ipad's oriented the buttons

1528
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,960
will be in technically different order

1529
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,960
so i it should be everywhere i don't

1530
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,200
know why this is just a thing

1531
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,359
for the ipad mini but it is as of right

1532
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,799
now they should do it on the phone too

1533
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,400
like if they make the decision that the

1534
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,319
button on top is always the up volume

1535
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,559
button for the love of god do it with

1536
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,319
all of your volume buttons don't do it

1537
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,480
with one of your volume buttons

1538
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,400
it's a very strange decision but that's

1539
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,680
that's kind of just how that sounds

1540
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,799
right now

1541
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,599
the ipad mini now is it's the only ipad

1542
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,440
i'm using okay so you used to have just

1543
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,960
the regular size one right you didn't

1544
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,920
have the pro no i have both pros okay

1545
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,160
but i so i had the big one

1546
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,000
that was what i always had started with

1547
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,040
that and then with the 11 inch

1548
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,200
i kind of started to move away from it

1549
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,880
and then once i once i kind of became

1550
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,119
big mac boy again

1551
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,079
i stopped using the 12.9 inch completely

1552
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,880
and was just using the 11 inch ipad pro

1553
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,880
pretty much exclusively at home as my

1554
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,640
home computer you know it's like i'm at

1555
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,079
home i'm doing things no matter what it

1556
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,240
is i'm going to use my ipad for it but

1557
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,240
now that has transitioned to the ipad

1558
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,559
mini because by and large what i'm doing

1559
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,000
when i'm at home

1560
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,119
is like content consumption stuff

1561
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,200
and i feel like this ipad mini is like

1562
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,359
the best content consumption ipad that's

1563
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,880
ever been made like

1564
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,160
screen is just big enough for video and

1565
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,760
it's so small that you can hold it

1566
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,240
really comfortably in one hand and it's

1567
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,799
also whilst very small especially in

1568
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,960
like especially when you have the the

1569
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,119
keyboard up in landscape you don't

1570
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,559
really get a lot of information on the

1571
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,119
screen it's big enough that i can like

1572
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,960
respond to some email check a couple of

1573
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,960
spreadsheet things if i have to

1574
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,440
and so i am actually

1575
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,359
now i'm going to be selling my big ipad

1576
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,559
my 12.9 oh just don't use

1577
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,680
that size class for me is done now the

1578
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,680
smaller ipad pro

1579
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,680
i do like that i have i haven't decided

1580
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,520
that may go but i've not i've not made

1581
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,760
up my mind on that yet completely

1582
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,760
because the magic keyboard is such a

1583
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,680
fantastic tool

1584
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,160
and you know being able to have an ipad

1585
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,480
with that keyboard right there is is

1586
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,880
really great i wish that there was some

1587
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,640
kind of solution for the ipad mini not

1588
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,040
an impossible task but a very difficult

1589
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,720
one like what are you going to do a

1590
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,240
one-handed dvorak layout on that

1591
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,559
keyboard

1592
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,079
space a ipad mini keyboard before

1593
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,079
so bridge keyboards they used to make an

1594
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,880
ipad mini keyboard and very small but it

1595
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,119
could get the job done nevertheless like

1596
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,440
so i'm not i don't really know exactly

1597
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,839
what the ipad pro will be for me in the

1598
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:32,799
future

1599
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,079
because the question mark that i keep

1600
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,599
having is like they're not going to

1601
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,200
update this mini as much as they update

1602
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,079
in ipad pro and you know if i if i'm

1603
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,760
like oh i'm all mini all the time

1604
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,520
nothing's ever going to change me in

1605
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,359
four years time i'm gonna be really

1606
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,280
upset because you know they just haven't

1607
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,119
done anything with it so i don't really

1608
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,720
know exactly what the future holds for

1609
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,440
me

1610
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,160
when it comes to the ipad but right now

1611
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,319
because this ipad mini has all of the

1612
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,400
specs that i care about the most you

1613
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,960
know like it's fast and it's capable i

1614
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,280
can do anything i want with it it really

1615
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,520
has just become like this is the perfect

1616
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,200
ipad for what i'm using an ipad for now

1617
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,599
i'm gonna recommend with the keyboard

1618
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,040
stuff like i

1619
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,119
think on the mini it's way better to

1620
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,599
float the keyboard and use the little

1621
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,160
floating like iphone style keyboard

1622
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,839
instead the swipey guy yeah i've been

1623
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,280
doing that i've been doing that more

1624
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,960
i've been doing the split keyboard a bit

1625
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,880
too but the floating one is the best one

1626
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,640
because you could still just use one

1627
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,559
thumb while you're holding it

1628
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,079
to do all of that so that that works

1629
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,599
pretty well i've i have bumped into a

1630
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,599
few applications that don't handle that

1631
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,000
very well i don't know why i've had some

1632
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,760
stuff like since the ipad mini come out

1633
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,920
where like there's been some weird like

1634
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,440
just ui things that have been going on

1635
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,520
which is starting to get cleared up but

1636
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,440
one of my favorite was the

1637
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,000
carrot weather widget like the widget

1638
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,400
shows you like a seven day forecast and

1639
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,839
it would show me monday tuesday

1640
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,160
wednesday and sunday

1641
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,920
because thursday friday and saturday

1642
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,920
would get cut off and that was very

1643
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,599
funny to me you know like just a couple

1644
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,200
of days would just get cut out of the

1645
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,359
widget you know because it it is

1646
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,280
slightly different in size and all that

1647
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,799
kind of stuff and so with these kinds of

1648
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,240
things because they just drop them all

1649
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,559
of a sudden some developers yeah this is

1650
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,240
always the case when when apple has a

1651
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,079
new screen size is you have to expect

1652
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,440
for the first month there's a lot of

1653
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,040
like ui weirdness oh the magic app isn't

1654
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,040
full screen there's weird black bars on

1655
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,319
the side it's like right because they

1656
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,559
had no idea this was coming and yeah

1657
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:27,760
i've definitely noticed a few other

1658
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,920
things that are that are a bit weird

1659
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,599
the other thing that like this this one

1660
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,400
reminded me that i totally forgot

1661
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,880
that i used to do is is like that split

1662
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,880
keyboard where you can use two thumbs to

1663
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,760
type

1664
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,920
uh on either side of the screen

1665
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,640
i find that a really comfortable

1666
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,319
input method and i forgot that i used to

1667
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,960
with one of my very old minis sometimes

1668
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,640
take it out on a walk

1669
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,440
and use that double thumb split keyboard

1670
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,839
as a way to like write down ideas really

1671
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:58,880
quickly

1672
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,640
and i've been doing that again like as

1673
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,160
i've as i've been taking little walks

1674
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,319
around here and i just love it as an

1675
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,160
input method i find it just very

1676
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,359
pleasant

1677
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,160
it's faster than on the phone with one

1678
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,640
thumb but the device isn't so big that

1679
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,040
it like i'm not gonna take my giant ipad

1680
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,280
pro out for a walk and use like a split

1681
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,359
keyboard on either side like that's dumb

1682
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,079
i just i really like the size of it and

1683
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,400
i also find with the cover and ah

1684
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,040
hallelujah the flat sides like when you

1685
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,960
fold that cover back and with the flat

1686
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,920
sides

1687
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,559
it's so comfortable to hold and i feel

1688
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,119
like i have such a solid grip on it

1689
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,920
that it is a thing that i can like take

1690
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,079
out for a little walk to the local

1691
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,400
coffee place and like have out while i'm

1692
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,400
walking and thinking and writing down

1693
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,880
some ideas like it's it really is just a

1694
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,960
fantastic little form size i think they

1695
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,440
did such a good job with it and

1696
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,880
i'm with you mike like for whatever

1697
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,480
reason apple seems to not enjoy updating

1698
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,280
their small devices but right now while

1699
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,760
it's new and it's still reasonably fast

1700
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,280
and can do all the modern things like i

1701
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,119
think it's a it's a fantastic little

1702
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,520
little ipad maybe if we just convince

1703
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,640
all the cortexes to buy them and maybe

1704
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,400
they will update it more frequently

1705
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,000
because like we just need to become

1706
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
complete evangelists for the ipad mini

1707
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,920
now which i have no problem being

1708
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,720
because it is an absolutely superb

1709
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,960
little device i have the purple one with

1710
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,400
the cherry case

1711
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,040
it's such a nice little pairing and

1712
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,359
this thing's gonna like one of the

1713
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:30,960
things that i've been struggling with

1714
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,640
when thinking about getting back into

1715
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,640
travel again is

1716
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,440
i'm not going to want to

1717
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,599
have just an ipad with me anymore which

1718
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,119
is what i was doing with some dreams

1719
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,760
before it was just an ipad like i'm now

1720
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,599
going to want to have a macbook pro with

1721
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,440
me especially

1722
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,520
when we talk about the new macbook pros

1723
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,799
in a minute

1724
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,640
and you know all i'm gonna want is to

1725
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,720
have a macbook pro with me

1726
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,880
and i was struggling about like would i

1727
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,160
wanna bring an ipad like i really love

1728
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,160
my ipad for like

1729
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,960
everything i do when i'm stationary you

1730
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,520
know like when i'm at home i barely use

1731
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,760
my phone i use my ipad you know like

1732
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,760
that's what i like and if i'm on

1733
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,559
vacation if i'm hanging out or in the

1734
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,720
room like i would want to use an ipad

1735
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,720
for all of those things right like when

1736
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,280
i'm not doing work but i'm not on the go

1737
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,880
like you know this is kind of the way

1738
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,160
that i like to

1739
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,039
to consume content and media and stuff

1740
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:29,119
and if i was gonna be bringing

1741
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,880
my ipad pro

1742
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,039
then that's like a big heavy thing

1743
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,319
because i'm going to bring my upper pro

1744
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:35,359
i'm going to bring it in the magic

1745
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,039
keyboard because of course and then it's

1746
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,319
like now i'm bringing two laptops of

1747
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,480
course yes right yeah 100 you're

1748
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,599
bringing to your laptop yeah and now

1749
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,200
with this little thing

1750
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,280
it just can just be thrown in the bag in

1751
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,280
like the book pocket not even in the

1752
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,520
laptop pocket like my tote bag has like

1753
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,119
a book pocket where i put my journal and

1754
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,599
this goes in with it like and it just

1755
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,280
feels like nothing it doesn't feel like

1756
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,880
i'm bringing any additional weight with

1757
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,799
me and it's just

1758
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,799
it's made even that

1759
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,559
kind of equation way easier for me we're

1760
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,000
like it's a no-brainer i'll bring this

1761
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,920
ip with me it's no problem i could just

1762
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,680
put it in my jacket pocket if i want to

1763
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,440
you could put it in your jacket pocket

1764
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,359
oh i put it in my pajama pocket it fits

1765
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,799
it's an interesting question i don't

1766
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,119
know if when i get my mini if it's a

1767
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,119
thing that i'll bring on trips with me

1768
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,760
but i will definitely be tempted i think

1769
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,559
i won't because my perfect travel

1770
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,160
solution is i have the macbook and i

1771
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,359
bring the big ipad pro because when i'm

1772
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,839
working i use sidecar to have the two

1773
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:38,799
screens for the computer which is

1774
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:41,599
one of my favorite things apple has ever

1775
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,319
done like god damn is that an amazing

1776
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,000
feeling yeah i mean you could do it with

1777
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,480
the little one if you want right i don't

1778
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,079
know how good it's gonna be you know

1779
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,680
like i'm actually sitting here right now

1780
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,599
i've never even tried i don't even think

1781
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,880
i've ever seriously ever used sidecar oh

1782
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,280
my god sidecar is the best mic it's my

1783
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,200
favorite thing ever that's apple i have

1784
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,680
like tried it but i've never like

1785
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,920
seriously used it so how do you use it

1786
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,640
do you set it up as a separate monitor

1787
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,280
or is it like just for certain apps

1788
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,440
yeah so it like sidecar allows it to

1789
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,280
function as a separate monitor that

1790
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,720
that's really all it is it's like you

1791
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,400
plugged in an external display to your

1792
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,440
computer

1793
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,319
and

1794
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,799
that that's why like you know on on my

1795
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,319
writing retreat it's like i've got my

1796
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,280
laptop and i have the second monitor and

1797
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,200
that allows me you know without having

1798
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,079
to actually bring a second monitor

1799
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,720
to have a really great working setup

1800
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,400
where it's like i can have notes on one

1801
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,079
screen and a script on the other and

1802
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,359
it's like

1803
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,119
yeah i know i can put them side by side

1804
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,960
on the same screen but it is so much

1805
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,960
nicer it's so much easier to be able to

1806
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,599
spread out across two screens like it it

1807
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,839
really is like whatever engineers that

1808
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,160
apple worked on sidecar like thank you

1809
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,240
it is my favorite thing in years and

1810
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,559
years that apple did and like

1811
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,200
it allows me when traveling to just

1812
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,039
really get so much more out of these

1813
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:01,839
things

1814
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,039
the only thing i'm always wondering is

1815
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,760
like hey could i connect more than one

1816
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,760
ipad to my laptop because i would

1817
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,319
totally consider doing it with three so

1818
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,480
i can have two screens on either side of

1819
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,400
my laptop when i'm working but it would

1820
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,280
be amazing if i could do that with the

1821
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,480
mini so do sidecar to the big ipad and

1822
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,480
do sidecar to the tiny ipad

1823
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,079
i wouldn't be surprised if sidecar

1824
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:25,920
doesn't actually work with the ipad mini

1825
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,280
i wouldn't be surprised if they hard

1826
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,520
coded that in to be like no i got it

1827
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,440
running right now oh it does work oh

1828
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,799
that's interesting okay i'll have to

1829
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,480
play hey look it's like a little touch

1830
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,599
bar down here what's going on i've got

1831
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,359
safari open and it's showing me all the

1832
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,079
tabs like a touch bar yeah the sidecar

1833
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,559
lets you have some little ios style

1834
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,160
controls along the side of your second

1835
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,839
monitor i turn all of those off because

1836
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,280
i just want to use it as a second

1837
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,359
monitor because i want to be able to use

1838
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,520
the keyboard on my laptop to just move

1839
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,640
between all of the windows and

1840
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,920
everything very quickly i'm not going to

1841
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,000
touch the screen all right well when

1842
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,280
we're done with the show i'm going to

1843
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,000
have to go try sidecar with my mini i

1844
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,440
don't think it will be the same but i'll

1845
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,200
be curious to give it a shot let me tell

1846
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,880
you it works

1847
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,680
it's

1848
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,079
fine

1849
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,640
any app i'm putting on this i have to

1850
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,799
significantly scale down in size but i

1851
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,400
don't know what do you put on the site

1852
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,000
like what are you putting on side car

1853
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,680
like what are you putting on the display

1854
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,400
so

1855
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,000
usually the way it works is i have like

1856
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
my script writing app on the main

1857
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,839
display and then i have

1858
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:30,559
notes or safari on the second display

1859
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,000
and so that's how i'm using it to like

1860
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,520
divide up the screen

1861
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,119
i think perhaps the only thing that

1862
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,960
sidecar would be useful for the mini is

1863
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,760
to just run carrot weather in it

1864
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,359
full screen so you have like a little

1865
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:42,880
display that shows you what the weather

1866
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,720
is i think that's about that's about

1867
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,799
what the mini size might be good for i

1868
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,200
just put slack there and like you know

1869
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,960
it's filling up the entire display or

1870
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,960
whatever but it's all perfectly readable

1871
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,200
because the screen's so crisp yeah i'll

1872
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,880
be curious to play with it but it's just

1873
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,119
i don't know maybe maybe like i just i

1874
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,960
tend to have apps

1875
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,119
bigger than i need them maybe on the mac

1876
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,720
in general because i have all the screen

1877
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,359
space you know but like i'm throwing

1878
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:08,960
things on there now and yeah i have to

1879
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,880
resize them or whatever but

1880
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,720
it works perfectly well interesting i

1881
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,000
might play around with it some more i

1882
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,079
think especially when i'm traveling i

1883
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,680
might play around with sidecar some more

1884
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,680
it's not really something that i've used

1885
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,240
very much because you know like i have a

1886
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,079
uh like a 30 inch display for my laptop

1887
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,400
and so i just use that one and for my

1888
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,119
imac i have you know the imac is 21

1889
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,280
inches and then i have another display

1890
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,839
on the side that the the dell display

1891
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,359
that i was using when i was using a mac

1892
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,599
mini on this desk i just turned it on

1893
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,440
its side so it's a portrait monitor and

1894
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,160
i have all of the recording tools just

1895
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,720
on that window so like my audio hijack

1896
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,559
and skype and all that kind of stuff is

1897
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,079
just on that monitor it's just left

1898
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,760
alone and never touched

1899
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,760
so you know i'm used to using maybe

1900
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,160
different displays situations where i

1901
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,520
don't know i don't find myself working

1902
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,520
just from a laptop very much so i

1903
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,440
haven't maybe felt the need to even

1904
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,119
think about what sidecar would provide

1905
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,599
me yeah i love it but it's also a side

1906
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,000
effect of i'm using the other full-size

1907
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,799
one which with my current laptop doubles

1908
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,960
the screen real estate and i just find

1909
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,559
really really useful and yeah that is

1910
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,238
cool though d cramps the writing

1911
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,080
environment like oh great i've got more

1912
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,238
space here for notes and scripts i don't

1913
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:21,600
have to flip back and forth between the

1914
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,040
two of them or i don't have to squeeze

1915
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,719
it so that either of them is half the

1916
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,640
half the single screen size but

1917
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,719
so i will because of that i will always

1918
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,399
be traveling with whatever the biggest

1919
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,960
ipad is that apple makes i mean i'll

1920
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,158
just put a little asterisk on that in

1921
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:35,759
case they make like a table size one i'm

1922
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:36,960
not going to travel with that the

1923
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,319
biggest one they currently make i'm

1924
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,560
gonna have but i could honestly find

1925
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,520
myself tempted to bring along the mini

1926
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,198
as well precisely for what you're saying

1927
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:46,719
because it feels like

1928
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,000
it's nothing to pack like why not have

1929
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,399
it it's a it's a great little size

1930
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,080
and there's lots of situations where i

1931
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,719
could imagine just wanting to especially

1932
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,120
when i'm traveling for a light day just

1933
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,439
go out with that mini and not take

1934
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,600
anything else so i think i will be

1935
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,920
tempted to travel with it even though it

1936
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,679
is somewhat ridiculous to be traveling

1937
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,238
with a laptop and two ipads i don't

1938
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:11,839
think i could bring myself to that

1939
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,920
honestly

1940
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,439
i'll be tempted i'll let you know next

1941
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,198
time i'm wrapping up all my packing i'll

1942
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:19,679
let you know what i've decided to bring

1943
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,279

1999
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,000
so we had to move this episode because

2000
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,320
of the travel stuff and then we moved it

2001
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,679
again

2002
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,000
and then we moved it one more time

2003
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,880
because apple had another event and i

2004
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,199
felt very confident that we would want

2005
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,120
to talk about what was announced in that

2006
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,320
event and

2007
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,000
we would have been recording just before

2008
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,920
it and i felt like that i didn't want to

2009
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,840
make another episode out of time yeah we

2010
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,199
didn't want to do two episodes out of

2011
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,840
time it was also partly my fault i don't

2012
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,199
know maybe we'll talk about it in more

2013
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:47,280
text but i did a little bit of like a

2014
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,400
trip within a trip so i i as always am

2015
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,880
constantly causing my problems with the

2016
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,640
scheduling so yeah we bump stuff back

2017
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,000
but when you told me like ooh there's

2018
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,040
going to be

2019
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,600
the macbook pro event maybe

2020
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,159
and we were scheduled to record the day

2021
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,760
before it's like well that just seems

2022
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,800
silly let's let's wait and see and

2023
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,040
i don't want to tip my hand mike by you

2024
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,800
know giving away my opinion right at the

2025
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,600
start but it was great to wait for

2026
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,600
these macbooks which as far as i can

2027
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,840
tell have been delivered

2028
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,360
directly from heaven by angels to us to

2029
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,920
use on earth not that you want to tip

2030
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,280
your opinions of it too soon

2031
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,360
they did it man they done did it though

2032
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,640
right like so we are recording just

2033
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,560
before we get them like maybe by the

2034
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,719
time this episode's out i might have my

2035
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,120
my i kind of spec mine out in such a way

2036
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,040
that it's taking a little bit longer

2037
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,120
like i i didn't just go with one of the

2038
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,600
default options like i made some choices

2039
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,159
so it's kind of coming towards the end

2040
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,800
of next week for me uh maybe the week

2041
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,640
after that but these computers are just

2042
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,239
they're just obscene in the greatest

2043
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,560
possible way i'm so excited man i was

2044
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,040
very fortunate because i was out

2045
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,199
traveling and filming and doing a couple

2046
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,440
things on the actual day but i got back

2047
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,320
to my hotel room just in time it was

2048
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,239
again it was it was perfect like the

2049
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,320
angels were guiding me to the exact

2050
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,560
perfect moment that i wanted to be at

2051
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,840
because when i turned on the apple event

2052
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,480
they literally just said like the one

2053
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,719
final word about their airpods and then

2054
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:24,080
they're like and now let's talk about

2055
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,040
the max great i've arrived perfect

2056
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,000
and it was 30 minutes of glory like

2057
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,840
rarely have i been so happy at an apple

2058
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,800
event

2059
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,880
for all of the stuff that they did with

2060
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,800
the laptops it like it just kept getting

2061
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,120
better and better and like

2062
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,120
i have been dying for an upgrade to my

2063
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,480
macbook pro

2064
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,640
and it's like man they they just they

2065
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,800
delivered on every

2066
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,840
single mark and

2067
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,360
you know i know a lot of professionals

2068
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,600
will talk about this sort of thing but

2069
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,480
my experience in particular was you know

2070
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,520
that day i had been out i had been

2071
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,560
filming something i was driving so i had

2072
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,040
two dash cams recording and i had

2073
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,280
another camera that was running in the

2074
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,600
car and i had like another camera that i

2075
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,760
was using and you know what i got back

2076
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,600
to the hotel room with

2077
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,120
handfuls of sd cards that i needed to

2078
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,159
unload onto my current laptop and so

2079
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,679
like when i'm watching this event and

2080
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:28,400
they said oh and we've put an sd card

2081
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,560
reader right in the laptop i'm like oh

2082
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,760
my god

2083
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,760
thank you so

2084
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,520
much like

2085
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,960
no port could be more welcomely received

2086
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,840
by me than that right now in this moment

2087
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,600
when i've got a pile of these freaking

2088
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,920
things and it's so annoying to use

2089
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,920
dongles and adapters to try to get it

2090
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,000
through and they're always so much more

2091
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,040
flaky like that's just the most minor of

2092
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,960
things that they put an sd card in but

2093
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,040
like like i couldn't have been more

2094
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,880
primed to be thrilled at that like one

2095
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,360
edition in that moment than than i was i

2096
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,840
was like oh my god please keep talking

2097
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,000
about these computers tell me more and

2098
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,159
boy did they have more yeah i think the

2099
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,159
whole ports thing is interesting because

2100
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,239
what they did with it really

2101
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,440
they made a bunch of niches

2102
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,640
of people happy and then someone like me

2103
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,840
who

2104
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,600
very rarely needs an sd card or hdmi

2105
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,800
port

2106
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,440
but i do need them you know maybe once a

2107
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,040
year i'll need it or whatever so it's

2108
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,719
like they make the make people who

2109
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,239
really need it really happy and then

2110
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,400
people like me it's kind of like okay

2111
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,400
great i know it's i have it now yeah

2112
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,920
like you know like i'm not i'm not like

2113
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,360
super excited about it they could have

2114
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,600
just given me and honestly i would have

2115
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,199
like probably preferred two more usb c

2116
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,040
ports or thunderbolt 4 ports than than

2117
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,679
those to be for me right like why not

2118
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,920
basically everything i own now is either

2119
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,840
that or i've replaced cables i've done

2120
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,960
that a lot i have usb b to usbc

2121
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,360
connectors uh for some of my audio gear

2122
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,880
right yep so like just over time i've

2123
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,239
been slowly

2124
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,640
changing them over anyway but also i

2125
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,239
guess like most people

2126
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,719
i've invested in docking solutions you

2127
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,880
know so like i'm not going to change any

2128
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,199
of that like when i'm at my desk i have

2129
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,560
a dock and it has all the ports that i

2130
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,920
need or whatever which is awesome but

2131
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,080
now i'm just pleased that they have done

2132
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,080
it for the people that need it i totally

2133
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,199
agree with that like and when they were

2134
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,040
talking about the hdmi port i'm

2135
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,880
literally not even sure what that's for

2136
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,560
like i think that's for external

2137
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,560
displays or something displays

2138
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,679
projectors in offices is a really big

2139
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,440
use case you know like you you need to

2140
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,800
connect to a projector to do your

2141
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,760
presentation having a hdmi port is

2142
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,679
massively helpful for that kind of stuff

2143
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,600
oh right okay so i guess that's the

2144
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,159
replacement for like those old vga um

2145
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,640
pin yeah the vga pin connectors oh okay

2146
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,840
all right that makes that makes sense

2147
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,000
then but yeah i thought like oh somebody

2148
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,600
somewhere is really happy about this

2149
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,679
hdmi port and i'm really happy about the

2150
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,840
sd card slot and

2151
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,920
this is what a pro machine should have

2152
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,679
is like these these solutions for people

2153
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,840
so yeah back when i used to get really

2154
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,640
annoyed about usbc i did look into like

2155
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,320
a whole bunch of the limitations and i

2156
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,640
and i do think the way the spec is for

2157
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,600
usbc i don't think we're ever really

2158
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,960
going to see more than four usb-c ports

2159
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,600
on a laptop just because of the like

2160
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,239
power delivery requirements for the for

2161
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:25,199
those versions so i think they are kind

2162
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,679
of always limited to four like i agree

2163
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,640
with you more usbc ports would be great

2164
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,640
but i think i have a better technical

2165
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,440
understanding of why nothing on the face

2166
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,840
of the earth has more than four usb-c

2167
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,560
ports which is hugely frustrating but at

2168
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,960
least i can now like accept it for what

2169
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,760
it is i will say for me technically i'm

2170
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,159
gaining one because my 13 inch macbook

2171
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,280
pro only has two usb c ports

2172
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,080
and so the new 14 has three and then

2173
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,520
magsafe

2174
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,600
which i'm pretty excited about coming

2175
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,159
back as a as a charging option like

2176
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:03,440
magsafe is a better charging connector

2177
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,640
than usbc like it's way nicer and i like

2178
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,880
that they didn't create an integrated

2179
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,960
brick this time like it's it's just a

2180
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,920
cable it's like usbc on one end magsafe

2181
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,000
on the other end that's pretty sweet

2182
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,840
yeah i'm happy about that like while i

2183
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,280
am trying to

2184
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,040
very slowly convert everything in my

2185
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,360
life to usbc and i want to limit the

2186
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,760
number of connectors that exist

2187
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,000
magsafe is the only one they could bring

2188
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,440
back that

2189
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,640
i'm happy to add to the list of things

2190
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,360
because again especially while traveling

2191
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,280
it is like like even right now i mean my

2192
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,320
parents

2193
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,360
uh

2194
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,440
i'm in my parents walk-in closet with a

2195
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,840
bunch of clothes uh to try to dampen the

2196
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,840
echo so the recording is is much better

2197
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,880
this time

2198
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,000
but like

2199
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,840
when you're using your laptop on the

2200
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,840
road in a bunch of weird spots like

2201
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,960
right now i have a usbc wire that is

2202
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,600
just it's under tension to reach the

2203
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,560
plug on the other side and it is just

2204
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,960
begging for me to trip over it and smash

2205
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,640
the laptop and mess up the recording

2206
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,280
gear so like magsafe is the one where

2207
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,760
like that additional feature of just

2208
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,080
just breaking upon contact

2209
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,120
is really useful and i have totally

2210
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,520
on the road like had some real dicey

2211
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,640
moments of oh god the laptop's about to

2212
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,520
go flying so i'm very happy to have that

2213
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,360
back as well and

2214
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,000
you know it it really does feel like

2215
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,840
a useful additional connector to have

2216
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,159
for people who are using the laptops in

2217
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,800
unusual situations where the probability

2218
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,920
of snagging the the charging cord is way

2219
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,040
higher so

2220
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,199
yeah i'm very very happy to bring that

2221
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:46,480
back it is funny to call it magsafe like

2222
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,320
to have both products called magsafe

2223
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,600
because

2224
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,800
there is no safe part in the phone

2225
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,040
like it there's no safe like if you trip

2226
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,040
over a magsafe connector attached to a

2227
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,800
phone the phone is going with the

2228
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,560
connector it's funny i totally forgot

2229
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,480
that apple called the other one magsafe

2230
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,480
because yes that doesn't make any sense

2231
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,760
at all and

2232
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,760
it's funny i'm cur i'm currently going

2233
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,600
to put that one as one of their weirdest

2234
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,679
connectors i still feel like i don't

2235
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,120
really know what they're up to with that

2236
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,159
iphone mag safe connector um but

2237
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,000
whatever we'll see just like wireless

2238
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,960
charging but make it prettier yeah it's

2239
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,639
wireless charging but it's connected i

2240
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:24,239
don't know but also like why can't i put

2241
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,320
that magsafe connector on the back of my

2242
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,480
ipad mini shouldn't i be able to do that

2243
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,239
now oh i really wish they would have

2244
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,679
done that that would be so sweet at

2245
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,440
least i see at least they put usbc on

2246
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,440
the ipad mini though so

2247
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,679
you know it's not all bad yeah oh let me

2248
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,840
just minorly complain about pro stuff as

2249
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,480
well let me tell you when you've shot

2250
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,920
several hours of hdr video footage on

2251
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,800
your new pro phone and you go to

2252
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,880
download that onto your computer over a

2253
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,360
lightning connector boy are you made

2254
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,239
aware of how slow lightning is for

2255
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,960
transferring big file sizes

2256
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,800
i've never been more annoyed i was like

2257
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,719
god damn it guys if you're gonna have a

2258
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,880
pro phone that's shooting files that are

2259
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,520
like 50 gigs in size you should probably

2260
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,560
put a usbc connector on your phone if

2261
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,159
you really want people to be using this

2262
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,639
for video production but anyway we're

2263
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,080
not complaining about the phones we're

2264
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,320
talking about laptops from heaven which

2265
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,360
are just

2266
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,199
fantastic like i think the other thing

2267
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,360
that i was really happy about is those

2268
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,840
processors that they put in there

2269
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,800
are

2270
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,120
totally nuts like the numbers that they

2271
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,719
were giving for the faster render times

2272
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,239
again i could not have been more

2273
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,159
receptive to this because like i

2274
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,360
mentioned really quickly when i was

2275
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,440
working on that poem video because that

2276
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,080
was an unusually long video and it also

2277
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,800
had an unusually large number of cuts

2278
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,800
and it was doing more complicated things

2279
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,040
like mixing in real footage with

2280
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,320
pre-rendered animation stuff that took

2281
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,000
forever to render the final version on

2282
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,080
my computer i think it was like

2283
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,400
four hours to render the final version

2284
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,880
of that thing at full quality

2285
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,800
and these are laptops for professionals

2286
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,960
i'm very glad to have this macbook pro

2287
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,840
but dan like those four hours definitely

2288
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,480
meant like some days it was just too

2289
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,320
late to be able to upload the video

2290
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,159
anyway so it would cost me a day and

2291
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,159
then i'd be working the next morning so

2292
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:20,320
it's like holy moly if there's a laptop

2293
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,639
that can cut a five-hour project down

2294
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,480
into a one-hour project

2295
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,520
it's like

2296
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,920
tim apple you can't take my money fast

2297
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,239
enough to get that laptop i just opened

2298
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,639
my wallet and i told him to reach in and

2299
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,560
take however much he wanted out and give

2300
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,120
me the fastest laptop they made

2301
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,760
because yeah it really matters

2302
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,400
for rendering big complicated video

2303
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,320
projects and

2304
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,320
that doesn't matter all the time but

2305
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,560
when it's a problem it can be a real

2306
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,480
critical problem and really delay a

2307
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,679
project so i was just thrilled with that

2308
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:54,960
they were talking about like these

2309
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,360
laptops with the m1

2310
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,120
pro max chips can render i don't

2311
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,400
remember which one was probably the m1

2312
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,520
max but can render a video faster than a

2313
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,920
mac pro with an afterburner card in it

2314
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,960
yeah yeah which is just that's obscene

2315
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,679
i think people under appreciate how much

2316
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,679
apple is quietly pushing into

2317
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:17,760
the entertainment industry on the

2318
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,600
production side

2319
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,600
it's little things like this like the

2320
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,960
you know the reason that it can render

2321
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,120
that so much faster is because they

2322
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,320
designed part of the max processor

2323
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,199
to specifically handle the pro res

2324
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,560
format which is what final cut uses

2325
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,800
when you're working on videos

2326
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,000
you know it's like this is all the stuff

2327
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,120
that i use

2328
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,159
and so

2329
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,760
this is apple at their best where it's

2330
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,320
like if they control the whole stack

2331
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,199
they've

2332
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:47,280
made final cut which is the software

2333
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,360
using to make videos they've helped

2334
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,800
design the video format that the program

2335
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,760
works in and then they can also design

2336
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,480
the chip that it's running on to have

2337
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,520
hardware designed to accelerate just

2338
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,800
this part

2339
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,320
like that's why they're able to hit

2340
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,480
these totally crazy numbers

2341
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,639
and i think anyone who works in the

2342
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,719
entertainment industry has to take

2343
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:13,360
notice at that kind of stuff because

2344
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,199
long render times

2345
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:17,760
are total killers for projects and again

2346
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,159
my my videos are short and small like i

2347
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,639
know people who make longer videos

2348
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,080
you know and they have to

2349
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,199
especially if they're traveling and

2350
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,560
they're just using a laptop like they

2351
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,239
have to dedicate a whole day just to

2352
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,960
rendering out like a two-hour video file

2353
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,679
i remember that mkbhd would take an imac

2354
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,800
pro with him to events yeah because he

2355
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,360
used to try and use a laptop and it

2356
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,520
would mean he couldn't upload before he

2357
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,120
would leave because he's doing

2358
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,360
everything in like wild 8k and all that

2359
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,800
kind of stuff you know yeah and people

2360
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,080
hear something like that and they think

2361
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,840
it's crazy but this is also where like

2362
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,360
you have to think about it in a

2363
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,760
professional setting where the you know

2364
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,880
the difference to mkbhd about being the

2365
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,360
first or the fifth to upload a video

2366
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,440
about a brand new technology product

2367
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,239
like the difference to him is worth way

2368
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:07,040
more than like the cost of bringing that

2369
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,000
imac pro with him to render the files

2370
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,920
it's just interesting like i i look at

2371
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,840
what apple's doing and i think

2372
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,080
they are really trying to take market

2373
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,320
share from adobe

2374
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,600
with this key selling feature of like

2375
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,120
but look how fast we can render out the

2376
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,520
final video project why do you think

2377
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,199
they're doing this because it just felt

2378
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,040
like they didn't care for a while like

2379
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,960
what do you have any kind of feeling on

2380
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,480
that like i agree with what you're

2381
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,400
saying like they're they're building

2382
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,040
into the chips like which is

2383
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,960
really super interesting the ability to

2384
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,040
handle all this stuff better but like it

2385
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,199
feels like it can't be that many people

2386
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,199
like it's like an interesting thing to

2387
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:51,520
go to these kinds of levels for it so

2388
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,080
here's my estimation again just from

2389
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:54,800
like

2390
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,960
being a youtuber i'm on the edges of

2391
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,960
some people who work in the the real

2392
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,159
entertainment industry you know on like

2393
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,239
big projects

2394
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:06,960
and what i my take on this is yeah

2395
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,679
you're right this isn't a huge market in

2396
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:12,480
the sense of the laptop market is tiny

2397
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,560
compared to the iphone market and then i

2398
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,719
think when you're looking at people who

2399
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,880
work in professional video production

2400
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,199
that is much smaller again than the

2401
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,400
laptop market

2402
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,800
so it's not a huge number of people but

2403
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,120
the budgets for

2404
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:30,320
big proper professional like hollywood

2405
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,440
and tv and netflix productions

2406
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,280
they're huge

2407
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,360
and so what i think apple is trying to

2408
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,520
go for here is

2409
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,760
the market is not big

2410
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,760
but for those people

2411
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,560
the cost of the hardware

2412
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,400
is a trivial part of the whole cost of

2413
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,480
the production you know so like you're

2414
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,400
you're making a tv show

2415
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,239
and even if we take a look at the mac

2416
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:58,400
pro and it's like okay you say you fully

2417
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,280
spec out a mac pro and it's 20 grand

2418
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,320
that's like

2419
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,120
nothing in the budget for making a tv

2420
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,280
show for a streaming service it's like a

2421
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,080
trivial cost compared to everything else

2422
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,520
so

2423
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,080
i think apple is pushing in this way

2424
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,360
because

2425
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,360
it's just a market

2426
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,960
for whom the cost of the product is

2427
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,800
almost irrelevant compared to their

2428
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,320
other costs

2429
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,000
and also

2430
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,159
the computers that are rendering the

2431
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:31,760
final products are very frequently the

2432
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,480
bottleneck for lots of other things to

2433
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,440
happen

2434
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,760
they're the bottlenecks for say being

2435
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,040
able to

2436
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,840
render a file of the production in

2437
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,639
process for one of the executive

2438
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,480
producers to watch because you can't

2439
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,800
have him like watch your raw version

2440
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,239
like that's your editing you need to

2441
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:51,760
render something for him to be able to

2442
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,600
see if you're working on like a big

2443
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,280
complicated thing that's going to take a

2444
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,040
long time you know let alone whenever

2445
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,280
you have a deadline for a tv series or a

2446
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,000
movie it's like boy you better hit it

2447
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,239
and guess what you know like i know this

2448
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,719
from my own teeny tiny projects after

2449
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:09,120
you render the file you better watch it

2450
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,880
through all the way to make sure there

2451
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,960
wasn't a last-minute mistake and if you

2452
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,040
make a last-minute mistake you have to

2453
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,840
re-render the whole thing and so as you

2454
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,560
get closer to whatever the deadline is

2455
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,600
if you're working on something

2456
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,159
complicated and it takes a day and a

2457
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:25,679
half to render

2458
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,280
and then there's an error after it's

2459
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,760
done and it takes another day and a half

2460
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,840
like you can be in trouble

2461
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,440
real fast

2462
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,000
and there's huge amounts of money on the

2463
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,920
line for hitting you know production

2464
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,040
deadlines

2465
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,120
so that's like i don't know for sure but

2466
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,840
that's my feeling about why is apple

2467
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,520
pushing in this way

2468
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,400
is they've identified a market

2469
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,800
that has a problem they can totally

2470
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,199
solve because they control the complete

2471
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:54,239
stack

2472
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,960
and who is also willing to pay

2473
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,159
almost any amount of money to make this

2474
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:03,040
problem uh significantly better so i

2475
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,600
would easily predict that

2476
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,040
these laptops like it's their first go

2477
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,480
at doing this

2478
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,800
but i expect when they come out with

2479
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,400
their next mac pro with their new chips

2480
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,920
the numbers that they're going to be

2481
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,880
able to put up for rendering projects on

2482
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,639
final cut i think those numbers are

2483
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,040
going to be insane

2484
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,480
right they're going to be able to say

2485
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,960
like we can render a video file in 150

2486
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,480
at the time right

2487
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,440
and and that's where like those mac pros

2488
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,080
are not for normal people

2489
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,159
i think everything the way apple talked

2490
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,400
about their old mac pros and i bet even

2491
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,239
more so for the next one

2492
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:43,120
like

2493
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,520
no normal person should buy a mac pro

2494
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,760
they are pitching this as a solution for

2495
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,679
the entertainment industry i think

2496
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:52,560
that's going to become even even more so

2497
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,639
what do you mean if you wanted a really

2498
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,560
powerful mac oh man i want the most

2499
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,719
power in my macintosh or like you know

2500
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:01,040
like oh i make some youtube videos every

2501
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,040
now and again like it's not my it's like

2502
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,199
a side thing for me but i want to spend

2503
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:07,199
waste not waste time or you know like or

2504
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,199
whatever like you get a get a mac pro

2505
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,440
right you're like oh i just like to own

2506
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,600
the fastest mac i can own i'll get a mac

2507
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,360
pro i just don't think that many of

2508
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,199
those uh reasons are going to exist

2509
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:19,760
anymore because the laptops are so

2510
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,000
incredibly powerful the next imac

2511
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,600
revisions are going to be so incredibly

2512
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,600
powerful and that's before you even

2513
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,280
start getting to the mac pro so like i

2514
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,639
think it's going to become even more

2515
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:30,719
edge of edge case right i see what

2516
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,400
you're saying yeah yeah just as a little

2517
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,480
example but you know even if it's come

2518
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,159
up on this trip it's like oh

2519
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:38,639
the new macbook pros

2520
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:39,920
the display

2521
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,560
allows you to actually color grade

2522
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,360
properly to hdr footage on the current

2523
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,400
macbooks you can kind of do it and

2524
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,600
you'll know it'll be mostly okay but

2525
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,120
it's not actually going to be the way

2526
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,120
that it really looks it's like oh on the

2527
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,000
new ones you can properly grade hdr

2528
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,480
footage to the right color why would

2529
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,320
they do that like that's not a feature

2530
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,159
that basically anyone in the world cares

2531
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,400
about unless you're in video production

2532
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,560
and even there you have to be in pretty

2533
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,639
high-end video production to care about

2534
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,400
that i do think that there is a certain

2535
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,560
type of buyer which includes me which is

2536
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,320
like i just like knowing i own a

2537
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,320
computer that can do that oh yeah yeah

2538
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,600
obviously there's there's a way that

2539
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,280
they can talk about it and it's just

2540
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,960
like oh it's cool to know that your

2541
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,679
computer now has a a trillion to one

2542
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,520
contrast ratio like they love being able

2543
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,760
to say those numbers but i'm just saying

2544
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,520
getting it to the point where it can

2545
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,719
color grade hdr footage is a very

2546
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:37,040
different and also very specific thing

2547
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,679
to hit that's different from just like

2548
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,159
we made the colors even better so i just

2549
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,239
feel like the messaging here is really

2550
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:45,360
like

2551
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,679
it kind of reminds me of how ages ago

2552
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:51,040
apple really made a push into schools to

2553
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,679
be you know in the education world it

2554
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,360
just feels to me like they're trying to

2555
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,080
do that now that they're trying to push

2556
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,360
into the entertainment production world

2557
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,760
and i i suspect like apple has a little

2558
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,560
bit of a problem if you compare final

2559
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,920
cut to adobe software which is i've used

2560
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,600
both i know lots of people who are

2561
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,600
familiar with both

2562
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,520
i would say the general consensus is

2563
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,400
that final cut is much more pleasant to

2564
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,440
use but it's a program that works best

2565
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,480
if you are an individual you can use it

2566
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,400
in teams but it is a little bit more

2567
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,600
work to do that whereas adobe is clearly

2568
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,719
designed as like a team's first product

2569
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:34,320
but i think like maybe what apple's

2570
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,080
trying to go for here is they're trying

2571
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,840
to catch people

2572
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,360
like they did in education where

2573
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,600
someone is at the start of their career

2574
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,360
in entertainment maybe they're a person

2575
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,880
who has a youtube channel and they're a

2576
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,520
one-person show or they're just an

2577
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,199
influencer who's like using their

2578
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:53,520
computer to put together videos

2579
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,400
and as that person grows

2580
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,600
banking on oh they use final cuts and

2581
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,280
they got familiar with this and they're

2582
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,639
using a mac

2583
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:05,360
and then as these like new people get

2584
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,840
larger in the entertainment world

2585
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,760
they're the ones since they like and use

2586
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,679
final cut who can enforce that like okay

2587
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:13,120
my little production company we're going

2588
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,280
to standardize on final cut we're not

2589
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,520
going to standardize on adobe because

2590
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,760
it's what i know i don't know if that's

2591
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,520
true but that's kind of my guess is i

2592
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,960
feel like maybe they're trying to catch

2593
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,880
people at the start

2594
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,040
get them familiar with final cut by

2595
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,800
having all of these huge advantages like

2596
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,880
everyone knows if you're making videos

2597
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,480
final cut on a mac is huge and fast and

2598
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,480
then you know standardize your small

2599
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,760
production house when you become

2600
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,679
successful around this product and then

2601
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:41,440
when you're running a production house

2602
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,960
and you start dealing with much much

2603
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,199
bigger budgets you don't care at all

2604
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:47,360
about how much the new mac pro costs you

2605
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,040
just want the fastest computer that can

2606
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,040
render it so i don't know i could be

2607
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,560
wrong but that's kind of my guess about

2608
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,400
what apple's strategy is here and i just

2609
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,159
feel like lots of things are pointing in

2610
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:57,360
that direction

2611
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,320
and this new amazing macbook pro

2612
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,159
feels to me like it has a lot of things

2613
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,920
pointing in that direction all right

2614
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,840
gary let's finish up on a hashtag ask

2615
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,639
cortex question for today i have one uh

2616
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,320
for you from eli

2617
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,639
and eli wants to know does gray still

2618
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:15,360
listen to girl talks all day

2619
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,800
i was just really listening to an old

2620
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,400
episode of the show and i'd totally

2621
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,320
forgotten about this album uh yeah

2622
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,159
actually uh good good timing for this

2623
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,800
question because my various i listen to

2624
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,040
songs on repeat go in and out of favor

2625
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:30,480
over uh the course of months and years

2626
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,560
and girl talk all day had actually been

2627
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,120
really out of favor for a long time but

2628
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,080
actually

2629
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,880
on this most recent writing trip it came

2630
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,360
back in a big way

2631
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,400
i listened to it just a ton

2632
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,440
and

2633
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:48,080
i think it's not a coincidence i think

2634
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,880
it happened precisely because

2635
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,239
like i just

2636
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:55,360
really 100 needed to get right back into

2637
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:58,400
writing when normally i would just

2638
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,639
collapse after a big video like the poem

2639
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:01,679
video

2640
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,920
and so uh yeah it actually was the first

2641
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,760
thing i queued up like the morning after

2642
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,679
that poem video went out it's like i got

2643
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:09,440
up it's like okay

2644
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,600
all right dude time to get to work uh

2645
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,040
and so i put on my headphones and i

2646
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,199
loaded up girl talk all day and yeah i

2647
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:16,639
hadn't listened to it in a really long

2648
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:19,280
time but i will say like god damn i love

2649
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,400
that album i think it is total genius

2650
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,440
and i listen to it on repeat in the

2651
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,440
mountains of switzerland

2652
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,560
probably

2653
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,040
200 times

2654
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,480
i haven't listened to it in a really

2655
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,000
long time i don't know if it's something

2656
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,199
that like you just put on in the

2657
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,840
background or just no it's focused

2658
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,719
to me it feels so specific yeah you you

2659
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,880
you've got to be like i want to listen

2660
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,639
to this album now

2661
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:45,920
right like i don't think it's like you

2662
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,840
don't just like like for me like one of

2663
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,119
the things that i was talking about

2664
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:52,719
around that time i think was uh tai cho

2665
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:56,239
taiko t ycho and and i can put that on

2666
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:59,040
in both instances i can put his music on

2667
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,280
when i'm just hanging out or i can put

2668
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,880
it on when i'm trying to focus for work

2669
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,800
like it works for both of those for me

2670
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,320
because it's more like

2671
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,000
it's got you know it's got a good beat

2672
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,560
to it that can pump me up but it also is

2673
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,480
pretty chill yeah he was a great

2674
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,320
recommendation of yours like i've added

2675
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,639
a ton of uh stuff of his to my playlist

2676
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,400
and he is on he is on the board he's

2677
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,080
like lo-fi

2678
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,199
chill hop adjacent kind of music yeah

2679
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,840
yeah it does it does hit both marks like

2680
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,440
you can have it as background music to

2681
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,840
just relax and you can also have it as

2682
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,080
music while you're working which um is

2683
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,960
is a it's a hard line to straddle for me

2684
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,719
but he definitely does that but the girl

2685
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,800
talk album is very much

2686
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,119
not background music i feel like cute

2687
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:42,880
it's a lot more in your face yeah

2688
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,239
[Laughter]

2689
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:46,400
that's some way to put it for sure have

2690
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,719
you tried out any of the spatial audio

2691
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:51,520
dolby atmos music that apple music has

2692
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,719
uh i don't know i don't think i've

2693
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:53,920
listened to any of the spatial audio

2694
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,440
music i've just listened to the spatial

2695
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:58,080
audio when watching tv sometimes which

2696
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,560
is very odd and i'm still

2697
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,159
i'm still not sure about it like i don't

2698
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:03,760
know why this audio needs to sound like

2699
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,520
it's coming out of my ipad i would just

2700
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,920
prefer it to sound like amazing surround

2701
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,159
sound but the music is more that the

2702
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:12,320
music is more surround sound than coming

2703
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,159
from the phone or whatever and it's kind

2704
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,159
of that's that's how it's made to be

2705
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:18,239
like the music is meant to kind of like

2706
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,800
surround you that's you know does more

2707
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,480
of that i don't know i mean maybe i have

2708
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,159
i g i've i've said before i feel like i

2709
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:25,600
have a real

2710
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,239
tin ear for music i'm not a very musical

2711
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,880
person and so it may be that i totally

2712
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,480
did listen to it and was just completely

2713
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,400
not aware i wouldn't be surprised

2714
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,480
by that but this is something like i've

2715
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,000
heard this at home i said to adina like

2716
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,159
oh try this and she just doesn't hear it

2717
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,840
and like it's just different people

2718
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,840
reacting in different ways like i have

2719
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,080
friends who hate it

2720
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,639
and i really like it you know like i

2721
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,960
think it's just it's it's definitely a

2722
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,119
personal preference thing about how you

2723
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:56,080

2741
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:35,440
through our devices and talk about all

2742
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,600
the services and applications that we

2743
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,239
enjoy using i think when maybe we'll

2744
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,880
touch on some ios 15 stuff like the

2745
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,560
focus mode stuff we might talk about

2746
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,719
that as part of the discussion uh for

2747
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:49,199
