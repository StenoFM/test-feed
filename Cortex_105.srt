1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
so here we are on a completely non

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,799
regularly scheduled

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,759
recording time yep no schedule well you

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,120
say that

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,320
there was i wish i had the audio

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,440
of our last recording session where you

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,520
said to me

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,720
what if we record every second tuesday

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,920
now

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,439
because as you said at the time you've

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,640
never heard me so happy right like it

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,439
was kind of like a

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,320
a moment where it was like almost

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,520
unbelievable

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,680
to me to hear you suggest that we set a

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,920
time on our calendar that we could

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,360
as i think i said at the time put a

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,520
repeating rule on

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,200
i mean yes you did sound like the

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,920
happiest boy in the world

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,960
and you were so happy i found it

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
surprising and

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
and uh not really quite what i was

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,559
expecting because

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,320
because if if i know because the thing

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,039
if i know when we're recording

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,280
i know when the show's coming out and i

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,120
can answer questions that i get

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
and deal with administrative stuff that

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,159
i need to deal with without either

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,400
a just randomly guessing or b

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,200
needing to pin you down for a minute to

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
ask you

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,000
right so like knowing is great but

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,320
nevertheless

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,200
our schedule was immediately broken the

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,200
first time

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,960
we didn't even get to one of these

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,200
scheduled recordings

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,240
well i mean yeah you are correct that i

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
was trying to do

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,079
is solve the problem of let's have

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,159
something

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,079
like here mike let me describe to you

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,280
what the advantage of schedules are

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,680
please please i need to know it's so

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
useful

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,680
uh it occurred to me that numerous times

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,920
over the past many years it's like oh it

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,479
might be useful to have like a default

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,920
recording day that's that is the the

52
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,720
thing is really what i was thinking of

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,640
is

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,920
let's let's have a day that if we don't

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,159
say anything we just know is the day

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,680
that is the recording day that that's

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,039
what i was that's what i was aiming for

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,160
and that is the real genuine like

59
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,720
relief for me of knowing roughly when i

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,520
can plan

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,239
to because there are times many times

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
where

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,520
we'll have a date that we were going to

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,879
do and we move it for some reason like

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,000
we did this one

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:28,480
and then the day before i'm like

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,519
is he remembered because

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,080
you're not wrong history to wonder has

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,920
proven that there are many times where

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,519
we had a day we moved the day because

71
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,599
you've got something happening

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,000
and then you forget yeah i think you you

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,519
have also developed a pretty good radar

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,319
for when is gray very busy

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,879
with some self-contained project yeah

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,440
and so like when is he extremely likely

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,040
to have

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
completely forgotten that the outside

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,239
world exists like i think you've gotten

80
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
a good sense for that over the years so

81
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,959
so you're not

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,800
you're not wrong honestly the last

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,440
couple of weeks have been like a real

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
good

85
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,360
like you know from the time before uh

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,239
you put out the grey was wrong video to

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
now like

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,239
i could i can sense when you're off the

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,000
radar a little bit

90
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,159
right and you know at that time it's

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,480
like fine like i know if

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,159
something's urgent i can flag you down

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
but otherwise i'm just gonna like batch

94
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,720
up my questions and we'll deal with them

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,400
later on right

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,760
yeah exactly um and so when that happens

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,239
i know that there is a strong likelihood

98
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
that if i can tell that you're still in

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,640
that mode

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,959
i need to like really triple confirm

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,360
with you that you know we're recording

102
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,159
yes yes yeah you're not wrong you're not

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,239
wrong at all

104
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,720
but yeah so i've just been trying to do

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
a bunch of much more longer term

106
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,040
planning and just thinking things

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,599
through and i was like oh hey

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,480
what i would like for cortex is just

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
some like

110
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,239
you said it exactly correctly i was

111
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,879
trying to think i want a repeating rule

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,120
for this

113
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,480
that can just be the default if we don't

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,959
say anything else

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,400
but then you are correct that we agreed

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,040
on that and probably

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,519
not but two days later like my whole

118
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
life

119
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,319
exploded and he's like well i'm gonna be

120
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,239
shockingly busy until this thing is done

121
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,840
so uh it didn't even occur to me when i

122
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,759
was like we gotta move back that cortex

123
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,959
recording date like this isn't happening

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,799
and i think the first thing he said to

125
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,079
me is like oh you've already broken the

126
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,880
schedule that you

127
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,080
you probably didn't get to one we didn't

128
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,360
even get to

129
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,680
one i'm so sorry mike

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
but look i had notice all i ever want is

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
notice

132
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
you know you just mentioned something

133
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
like i want to come back to the

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,199
scheduling thing

135
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,040
a little bit because like you are doing

136
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,520
some interesting stuff with scheduling

137
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,199
at the moment in your life which is it's

138
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,040
very fascinating to me you just put up a

139
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,160
video called weekend wednesday like you

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,199
have

141
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,040
not only you've completely upended what

142
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,240
a week looks like so yes you are doing

143
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
some interesting things

144
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,199
well yeah well you're also breaking the

145
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,960
timeline here mike because i haven't put

146
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,440
it up yet we're recording before it goes

147
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
out

148
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,440
no but we've specifically said we're

149
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,240
gonna wait although you've made that

150
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,400
promise

151
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
that you've made to me again a million

152
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,520
times where it's

153
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,759
i have a video that's coming now right

154
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,320
definitely coming out tuesday

155
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
yeah no 100 it's coming out tuesday mike

156
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,320
i believe that you believe

157
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,160
it right right which is why when i just

158
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,800
had to tell someone when the episode was

159
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
coming out

160
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,199
i said most likely wednesday right

161
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,960
because it could be thursday because the

162
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,880
video might come out on tuesday

163
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,400
because that's also like a thing that's

164
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,880
happened many times

165
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,800
and i'm not criticizing right like but

166
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,160
what i'm all i'm trying to prove in this

167
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
discussion here is

168
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,680
we're a good team because i know how you

169
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,039
work

170
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,840
right it's very kind of you yes that's

171
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,240
excellent i mean but it's you know yeah

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,960
yeah

173
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,919
people work in different ways like

174
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,080
cortex is

175
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,080
a thing that you do but you have a much

176
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,759
more time consuming thing that you do

177
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,360
podcasts are the thing that i do like

178
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,360
there's like it's all different

179
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,520
right like yeah you know this could

180
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
easily be the other way around but it's

181
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
not like this is just the way that it is

182
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
and

183
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,080
i'm more flexible in my schedule than

184
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,319
yours can be because there are like much

185
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,240
more dependencies so like anyway but

186
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,520
there was something you mentioned around

187
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,160
you were saying about like looking at

188
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,160
your schedule and thinking about things

189
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,160
it pointed to something that i've been

190
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,960
acutely aware of right now and then i'm

191
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,840
referring to

192
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,440
as being pandemic busy okay that i think

193
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,360
is a really could become a

194
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
real problem what do you mean by

195
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,560
pandemic busy

196
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,400
right so i think a lot of people right

197
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,039
now because their lives have changed so

198
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,720
much

199
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,560
they have like different demands on

200
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,440
their time they're

201
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,600
using their time in different ways that

202
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
people are starting to fill this time

203
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,039
with stuff

204
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,120
maybe they have a new project that they

205
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,800
want to work on a side project

206
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,720
or they are taking on more

207
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
responsibilities in their life in some

208
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
way whether it's with work

209
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,120
or like different family

210
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,800
responsibilities or social

211
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,080
responsibilities

212
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,960
that i'm worried that when life returns

213
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
to normal

214
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,759
people are going to be really

215
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,960
overwhelmed because they've taken on

216
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,360
so many things during the pandemic that

217
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,440
their normal lives would not allow them

218
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,240
to do

219
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,360
and i'm worried that like this is a this

220
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,639
is going to become a

221
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,039
problem for people afterwards like i'm

222
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,199
also

223
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,120
really worried about the ergonomics

224
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,039
concern that i have about people

225
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,479
um which is that like people working

226
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,000
from home now we spoke about this before

227
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,759
not considering their ergonomics

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840
think that they're totally fine because

229
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,080
it didn't start hurting immediately

230
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,120
but it doesn't it takes months to like

231
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
it's like i feel like

232
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,240
now we're in like the points like six

233
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,680
months right

234
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
now we're in the time when people's

235
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,639
bodies are gonna start breaking if they

236
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,919
weren't paying attention

237
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,080
yeah that's like a whole other thing but

238
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,720
this is the smallest thing that's a good

239
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,960
point yeah

240
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
for sure there's a lot of really wonky

241
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,440
home office setups where you're like oh

242
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,440
yeah this

243
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,120
this stool and this card table is

244
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,599
perfectly acceptable for me to work on

245
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,199
and then

246
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,639
six months later like why is my back

247
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,960
hurt so much exactly

248
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,800
well like oh i can just like stare down

249
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,639
at my laptop the whole time i don't need

250
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,919
to elevate and get an external keyboard

251
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,199
like that's not something i need it's

252
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,599
like no that's something you definitely

253
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,319
need

254
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,520
okay so so yeah so pandemic busy what i

255
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,039
thought you meant by this is like oh

256
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,440
people are just filling up their time

257
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
with

258
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,800
make work you know because they've

259
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,080
they've got nothing to do but so so this

260
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,520
is that's actually a good point so

261
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,599
what's that rule like you know work

262
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,080
expands to fill the time that you have

263
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,080
or something

264
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,919
like it feels like this is a variation

265
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,399
on people

266
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,240
always have a certain number of projects

267
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,880
or obligations in their life

268
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,599
and so like you so you think people are

269
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,560
filling

270
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,080
back up to whatever their personal level

271
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,599
of like this is the optimal number of

272
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,760
projects that i want to work on

273
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,600
they're filling up to whatever that is

274
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,120
without considering the fact that

275
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,240
they're going to need a lot more slack

276
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,360
in the system

277
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,839
when if real life returns

278
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
back and and comes in with like oh hey

279
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,440
remember commutes

280
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,320
remember all the office stuff that you

281
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
have to deal with

282
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
remember social obligations so that's

283
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,959
what you're concerned about it's like

284
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
people are loading up

285
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,000
and it's going to be like system shock

286
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,160
later

287
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
hmm it's a really interesting point

288
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,839
that's a really interesting point

289
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,920
this goes into my personal theory which

290
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,560
like where i am right now

291
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,120
in my life is believing things will go

292
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,360
back to

293
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,120
normal but it's going to be a long time

294
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,880
right like that's where i am right now

295
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,360
right where it's like i believe there

296
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,640
will be a restored sense of normality

297
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,440
in our future but it's still a way away

298
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,440
like it's still at least a year away

299
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,080
right like that's kind of where i am

300
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,519
right now and you know like we can argue

301
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,760
the specifics but

302
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,080
basically the idea of like we don't

303
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,080
think about lockdowns anymore

304
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,839
right it's like a thing in our lives and

305
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,680
you know like we start thinking about

306
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,440
like oh we should work in offices

307
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,279
now there is a whole other question

308
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
which i do want to get into more at some

309
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,399
point in the future where

310
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,399
i believe that office work is just going

311
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,080
to change because of the economics of it

312
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,920
not because of the disease

313
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,680
right not because of the virus right so

314
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,399
like there's a lot of companies now that

315
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,279
are like

316
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,279
holy we're saving millions right

317
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,839
why the hell do we have these offices

318
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,200
right

319
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,959
and so like i don't believe all

320
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,760
corporate real estate will go away but i

321
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,160
think

322
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,839
significant chunks of it will because

323
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,519
there are always jobs that people work

324
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,800
better in person or there are always

325
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,920
situations where like

326
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,839
there are people that can't work

327
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,160
comfortably at home it's not easy for

328
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,839
them

329
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,839
like they don't like it and it's good to

330
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,000
have options but i can imagine a

331
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,240
situation where lots of big companies

332
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
have maybe 50 of the office space that

333
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,760
they had before

334
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
so like that that's like a thing that i

335
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,519
think there will be changes

336
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,600
but the idea of like the way people live

337
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,600
their lives like i think it will

338
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,959
return to a sense of normality but we're

339
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,279
still away away from it

340
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,959
which is why this thing is concerning to

341
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,680
me of like we've still got a long time

342
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,440
to go

343
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,720
people don't want to be bored people

344
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,680
don't want to be sitting around doing

345
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,680
nothing

346
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,200
and or people see this as a time of like

347
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,480
look at this extra time i have

348
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,720
i have this project that i've always

349
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,560
wanted to do i've now saved

350
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
two hours of my day every single day

351
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,320
through not needing to commute

352
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
i can finally do that thing and then

353
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
they get used to that thing being in

354
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
their life

355
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,240
and then they need those two hours back

356
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,320
like it's just like a

357
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,600
and this isn't me saying like don't do

358
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,920
the thing right because

359
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,839
obviously we care like deeply on this

360
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,839
show about people having projects

361
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,279
right yeah but i think it's something

362
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,519
that we need to keep in mind

363
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,440
it started for me because for many

364
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,160
reasons some that we'll go into during

365
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
this episode

366
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,880
i am in a very busy time right now

367
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,399
and it's just been a thing where i've

368
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,240
thought huh

369
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,000
i feel busy again why and so like

370
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
i've come to the conclusion that the

371
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,519
stuff that i'm working on is short-term

372
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,120
and i would have just felt more busy

373
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,000
than i currently do

374
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,160
but it's about i'm i'm i'm trying to not

375
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
fall into the trap of i have a bit of

376
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,200
extra time free it's time to start a new

377
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
podcast

378
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,120
uh okay yeah yeah yeah cause i mean at

379
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,959
least from what i know about your

380
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,399
upcoming schedule it does strike me that

381
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,279
like oh yes this is just

382
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,720
a busy time as there are busy times so

383
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,320
you don't think that there's anything in

384
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
your personal life right now that you

385
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,000
would identify as like

386
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,040
oh no this is a pandemic busy project no

387
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,079
okay there's like

388
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,360
some social things have changed but i

389
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,079
think that they will just get

390
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,600
replaced but it's just a case of like

391
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,399
looking around at the people

392
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,880
in my life and looking at people like i

393
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,959
see online and stuff and it's like

394
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,720
hmm it's just been like a little a

395
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,399
sexist term that's just been bubbling

396
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,040
around in my brain a little bit

397
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,240
that i think i want to return to at some

398
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,240
point in the future

399
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
but i wanted to like float it by you to

400
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,160
see if it like held

401
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,079
i keep hearing people say like oh

402
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,839
because of the pandemic i'm like trying

403
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,480
out this new hobby or whatever which is

404
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,440
awesome

405
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,920
great use of your time but my concern is

406
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,720
that

407
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,680
there will then be a sense of overwhelm

408
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,519
later

409
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,040
hmm yeah i i think i think you might be

410
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,519
right i'm just i'm just sort of

411
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,360
mentally filing through all the like the

412
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,839
cards in my head for the projects and

413
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
things like

414
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,880
i don't feel like there's anything for

415
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,120
me that really

416
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,880
sticks out as that but the idea still

417
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,160
feels pretty valid though like oh this

418
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,920
is totally going to be a thing

419
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,000
because so like you were saying in that

420
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,160
i think it was in your q a video that

421
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,399
you'd put just put up slash are going to

422
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,079
put up have will put up have well

423
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,440
uh that you had a bunch of stuff on your

424
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,720
calendar right which obviously got

425
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,360
cleared off

426
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,480
but it's not like you're now not doing

427
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,600
anything

428
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,040
yeah yeah right so you are filling it

429
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,480
with other things

430
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,399
and and then there's just a question of

431
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,399
is this less or more

432
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,639
or could i potentially go through this

433
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,000
time and have come up with a really

434
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,279
great idea

435
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,720
that later on means way more work when i

436
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,160
can go back to doing those projects

437
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,760
again

438
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,600
i mean part of why i originally

439
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,560
suggested like let's have a default

440
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
cortex recording day uh even if it gets

441
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,680
moved

442
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,399
and talking about projects is i was

443
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,800
aware

444
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,800
suddenly of oh i need to really

445
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,800
seriously sit down and and plan

446
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,320
and think about the order of a bunch of

447
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,959
things that i was thinking i was going

448
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,920
to work on

449
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,399
like we've been long enough that i've i

450
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,639
recognized oh a bunch of these projects

451
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,160
they're not temporarily on hold and i'll

452
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,240
get to them in a month

453
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,920
it's more like okay assume these

454
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,160
projects simply cannot be done

455
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,000
or cannot be finished and if that's the

456
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,279
case you need to

457
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,120
like rethink in a really vague way

458
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
what does the rest of the year videos

459
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,920
look like like which topics are you

460
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,120
going to do or that kind of thing so

461
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,760
that's why i was in like a

462
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,440
scheduling mood and thinking about it it

463
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,839
doesn't strike me as pandemic busy

464
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,560
because

465
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,560
this is always a thing that i do is i

466
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,480
again i don't even this is not like any

467
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,040
target that i try to stick to it's just

468
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,160
the vague concept of

469
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,399
what are the next four to six

470
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,440
most probable main videos that are

471
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,120
coming up it's just

472
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,040
like a useful thing to think about but

473
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
you could see i guess if somebody

474
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,480
thought like you

475
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,320
a a little like enough that's someone

476
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,399
what are you enough like that they could

477
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,240
be planning out their next six videos

478
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,600
and then the travel starts again so the

479
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
four projects that they were working on

480
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,519
before and now

481
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,720
also in the hopper yes yeah exactly the

482
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,160
the the only thing that makes it

483
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,440
different for me is that because of the

484
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,240
way i structure my whole life

485
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,079
i'm able to then just push back and like

486
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,560
rearrange all of those projects

487
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,680
but yes like most people in most working

488
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,240
situations

489
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,839
projects come with more clear and direct

490
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,880
external dependencies

491
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,320
and obligations and so yes i can totally

492
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,600
see that that you can

493
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,360
very easily work yourself into way too

494
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,920
many obligations

495
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,000
that like just cannot possibly fit into

496
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,560
a normal person's life

497
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
once a normal person's life returns so

498
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,759
yeah i think it's a really valid concept

499
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,000
and i i think you're right

500
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,600
to i don't know maybe this feels like

501
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,399
the real danger zone

502
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
time for this of people having pandemic

503
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,160
projects and taking on more like

504
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
right now and then also you know real

505
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,680
life returning

506
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,040
maybe at some point on the horizon yeah

507
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,759
i think it's interesting because i don't

508
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,440
know about you

509
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,600
but like i feel like this is life now

510
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,040
yeah yeah i do i feel like i haven't

511
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,839
i've adapted

512
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,199
and it doesn't mean that i'm taking my

513
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,240
eye off the ball

514
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,720
what it means is like we have our flow

515
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
now

516
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,720
right like we know how we operate in

517
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,279
life

518
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,040
and so i think it's the time it could

519
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,920
for a lot of people where they were like

520
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,959
all right

521
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,759
this is what i'm used to for now uh so

522
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,440
what changes

523
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,759
right like maybe people are spending

524
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,839
like time reassessing

525
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,040
i like your weekend wednesday idea by

526
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,560
the way

527
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,399
i wished it was something that i could

528
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
easily implement but i have a lot of

529
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,120
like

530
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,880
scheduled projects on wednesdays right

531
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,680
yeah yeah then i don't need to move

532
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,800
but similarly though i do always try to

533
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,519
keep

534
00:16:50,800 --> 00:17:00,160
thursday or friday in a week pretty open

535
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:03,440
so i can have a backup weekend day

536
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,240
that happened this very week so i kept

537
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,720
pretty much most of yesterday free

538
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,559
because

539
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,160
you're working today right right which

540
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,400
is a saturday yeah i mean

541
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,240
the the weekend wednesday thing for me

542
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,480
is directly related to

543
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,600
quarantine and the evolution of the

544
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,079
thought starts with

545
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,760
a conversation you and i had at the very

546
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,919
beginning of this whole thing

547
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,760
where you were talking about taking the

548
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,679
weekend really seriously

549
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,919
this was part of the whole like what day

550
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,240
is it what month is it i have no idea

551
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,000
right

552
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,679
like you lose sense of time do i need a

553
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,480
giant sign in my house that says

554
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,120
saturday

555
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,400
right i thought that was it was a really

556
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,120
good point about

557
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
take the weekends seriously this is now

558
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,240
a vital thing

559
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,400
and it's also something i think just

560
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,799
generally over the past many

561
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,120
years of of my working in my life i've

562
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,480
never really taken the weekends

563
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,240
seriously you know this is always the

564
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,880
problem of being a self-employed person

565
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,160
is you know you can you can just very

566
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,679
easily end up

567
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,559
always working or half working which is

568
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,160
even worse

569
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,080
so i totally like i was like oh yeah

570
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,480
you're you're 100 right like

571
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,320
keeping psychological distance between

572
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,720
days on and days off

573
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,400
is a thousand times more important now

574
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,640
in the same way that like

575
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,080
exercise is mandatory it doesn't matter

576
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,039
what you think about it like you have to

577
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,200
do this now

578
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,280
but it started this thought process

579
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,559
because i've always like

580
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,480
whoever came up with the seven day week

581
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,080
is the worst number the seven day week

582
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,120
is like incredibly frustrating it's a

583
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,760
prime number

584
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
it doesn't divide easily i don't like it

585
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,280
two thumbs down

586
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,880
to the inventor of the seven day week i

587
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,559
found myself like taking the weekend

588
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,120
seriously but getting increasingly

589
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,240
annoyed

590
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,840
by the amount of time is just wrong and

591
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,360
i've tried to come up with various

592
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,480
schemes for

593
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,480
could i have a 12-day week that overlaps

594
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,240
with the seven-day week can you say

595
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,559
this this is the thing that you are not

596
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,240
allowed to keep doing well

597
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,480
i'll just change time i'll live on a

598
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,480
different time zone that you can't

599
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
like i can't just keep trying to do

600
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,799
these things

601
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,640
what do you mean i live on a different

602
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,200
time zone and my week lasts

603
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,919
12 and a half days well okay but so

604
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,679
here's

605
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,280
you know the problem is that the

606
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,039
external world exists

607
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,720
right and so you can have these like

608
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,640
these great patterns where you have

609
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,919
some very old calendars do this kind of

610
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,520
thing where it's like oh we have three

611
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,760
cycles there's a three-day cycle

612
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,280
and a nine-day cycle and a 12-day cycle

613
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,640
and like different combinations of the

614
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,840
cycles mean different things and it's

615
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,360
like oh look at this like

616
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,880
i think you could actually design

617
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,559
something that works pretty well

618
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,000
like for actual human time so it's like

619
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,880
but guess what

620
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,960
seven's a prime number so few right like

621
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,960
nothing you can possibly invent

622
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
is ever going to line up with the seven

623
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,360
day schedule

624
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,120
on any kind of scale you know it's just

625
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,640
like it just mathematically doesn't work

626
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,720
no matter how much you try

627
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,000
although i've tried many times right to

628
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,679
somehow defeat

629
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,520
prime numbers like i don't know what i

630
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,880
was thinking but yeah so

631
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,640
while i was taking the weekend really

632
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,480
seriously i just kept thinking that

633
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
everything about the this traditional

634
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,159
work week doesn't work

635
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,200
but is there something that i can fix

636
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,039
and

637
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,320
for me at least realizing that i find i

638
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,880
rarely really need the two days in a row

639
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,919
off

640
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,600
and that the two days off are sort of

641
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,600
they're ineffective being

642
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,720
back to back and so i thought okay

643
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
weekend wednesday

644
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,000
is going to be a weekend day and i'm

645
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,200
going to take that work day and put it

646
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,159
on saturday

647
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,799
so that i have two days of work one day

648
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,039
off

649
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,159
three days of work one day off and just

650
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,960
repeat that cycle

651
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,520
over and over again and i have to say

652
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
it's

653
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,720
it has been i've been doing it basically

654
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,840
the whole quarantine

655
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,520
and i love it like i just i find it is

656
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,159
perfect as much as can be done within

657
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,400
the constraints of a seven day week

658
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,159
this little pattern i think is about as

659
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,200
optimal at least for me

660
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,640
as as i can possibly make it and so uh

661
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,320
yeah that's why i made like this little

662
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,159
light gray video where i want to like

663
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,919
propagandize this concept

664
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,280
like obviously this is not going to work

665
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,039
for 99.9

666
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,720
of people on the planet but i think

667
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,559
there are enough people

668
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,760
who if they're able to have some control

669
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,159
over their schedule

670
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,799
might benefit from trying something like

671
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,000
this out

672
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,280
you know because again there's not

673
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
there's not an infinite number of

674
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
different types of people i think this

675
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,840
could really work

676
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,120
for some self-employed people or for

677
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,080
some students

678
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,760
and yeah i've just absolutely loved this

679
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,679
new schedule and i think

680
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,960
this is going to last for the rest of my

681
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,720
life i suspect

682
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,120
well beyond quarantine at least so what

683
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,520
day did you you removed saturday right

684
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,960
yeah so saturday is a work day right

685
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,880
that's that's what happened

686
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,880
i think the thing that i liked about it

687
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,600
the most which is a very good point of

688
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,039
like

689
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,720
if you work saturday that is like a day

690
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,799
when you can

691
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,080
put in things where you don't want to be

692
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,320
disrupted

693
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,600
yeah because nobody else is working so

694
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,559
they'll leave you alone

695
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,120
yeah yeah and and uh i mean a little bit

696
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,600
of this

697
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,039
comes out from back when i was being a

698
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
teacher like you have these days where

699
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,120
you're

700
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,720
you're supposed to put in like a certain

701
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,400
amount of time before the school year

702
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,320
starts up and i would always try to

703
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,080
strategize about like i want to go in on

704
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,400
the days when no one else is there

705
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,320
and you can get 10 000 times more done

706
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,120
when no one else is around

707
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,440
and i also find like even even for me

708
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,720
it's been useful to have a day

709
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,840
where it's just like the possibility of

710
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,120
the outside world

711
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,720
interrupting you is much lower uh like

712
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,919
with work related stuff

713
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,960
if you make saturday work day

714
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,400
and yeah it's just it's been it's been

715
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,440
really really great and i just

716
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,799
i find that that this

717
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,080
the cycle feels just about right i don't

718
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,840
have the feeling uh like i i did when i

719
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,200
was taking the weekend seriously but

720
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,640
still doing five days

721
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,480
in a row of like real work a feeling

722
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,919
like

723
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,360
thursday afternoon to friday felt like

724
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,440
really unoptimal time like i'm still

725
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,799
working but i'm working at a lower

726
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,520
percent efficiency than otherwise and so

727
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,520
i think like

728
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,720
having a weekend wednesday day as a

729
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,159
break day

730
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,880
really feels like it keeps the

731
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,080
efficiency up much higher for all of the

732
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,760
other work days

733
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,760
although again because i haven't

734
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,200
actually put that video up yet and we're

735
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,720
recording ahead of time

736
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,159
this is one of those videos that like

737
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,440
i'm a little worried about like how is

738
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,799
this going to be received like i don't

739
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,200
know if everybody's going to totally

740
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,080
hate this

741
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,679
look at you you can change your work

742
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,480
yeah this is this is totally

743
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,740
like well that's great for cgp grey you

744
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,400
know

745
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,840
[Laughter]

746
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,120
you know obviously there's no big

747
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,200
company in the world that would ever do

748
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,279
it because too many people would hate it

749
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,120
but again i'm thinking of you know some

750
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,240
of some of the teams of people that i

751
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,320
know

752
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,080
you know like in in youtube and

753
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,039
education land where they're like small

754
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,880
teams of people

755
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,480
i could totally see a small team of

756
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,840
people trying it out

757
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
and and thinking like oh this actually

758
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,640
works flexible time exists

759
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
yeah flexible time exists it's a thing

760
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,320
that lots of companies do

761
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,840
yeah and and even the people that i work

762
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,400
with are

763
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,640
very happy to have some concept of like

764
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,039
when is he around when is he not around

765
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,440
you know

766
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,440
like so even here like you know i don't

767
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,240
enforce a schedule on anybody

768
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,799
but just knowing like what days is great

769
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,520

770
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,480

if it was possible to like share a bit

779
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,200

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,360
november oh god what no that can't be

841
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,080
true that can

842
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,559
not be true i had the order in before uh

843
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,520
lunar new year

844
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,480
that was the goal i i put this order in

845
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,799
i believe

846
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:02,080
at the end of 2019.

847
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,360
did 2019 even happen was 2019 real like

848
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,000
it feels so long ago

849
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,919
okay at that point i really couldn't

850
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,480
remember what year was last year

851
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,360
i really could not remember that right

852
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,120
so i ever put it

853
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,960
i put this order in in either maybe like

854
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,840
december or maybe january of this year

855
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,200
but the idea was to beat luna new year

856
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,159
and for anybody that doesn't remember

857
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,679
coronavirus hit in china during lunar

858
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,399
new year like that was when

859
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,440
it spread because that was people coming

860
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,320
together

861
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,000
and that was that right so it is kind of

862
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,880
like when i look back on it now with

863
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,760
hindsight

864
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,000
it's like not a funny haha but like a

865
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,080
funny thing like i was very aware

866
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
more aware of coronavirus than most

867
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,640
people because our notebooks were

868
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,159
delayed

869
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,080
right but i never thought right like

870
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,240
nobody did i never thought

871
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,919
that this would happen you know i have

872
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,600
no concept of it

873
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,440
of something like this it's just like oh

874
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,480
maybe it'll be like swine flu

875
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,360
i guess no anyway so this

876
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,279
reprint is the order that has been uh in

877
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,559
the works for the best part of eight

878
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,679
months

879
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,760
and uh there the other thing is like i

880
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,440
cannot find the energy to actually talk

881
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,240
about all of this but like

882
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,240
it wasn't just this there were also like

883
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,039
multiple issues with this

884
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,159
preprint this was the one where gray you

885
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,000
may remember this

886
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,360
where they i think i told you about i

887
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,320
don't know if i've told this story on

888
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,919
the show where

889
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,960
i was sent box of samples of 50 samples

890
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,600
and only three

891
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,440
arrived oh right yeah and then two days

892
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,960
later the rest arrived because the box

893
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,480
was damaged but it's like

894
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,000
there's just been this is just this

895
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,640
entire rear print has been a comedy of

896
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,720
errors

897
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,559
but they are available now you can go to

898
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,039
contextmarch.com we still have a small

899
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,159
amount

900
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,320
left so if you do want one get one

901
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,760
and i will say just like we are working

902
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,399
on the second edition

903
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,679
this will most likely be the last

904
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,559
reprint

905
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,240
of the current version of the book so

906
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,840
the second version the book the

907
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,840
structure is the same

908
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,159
but there are some features that we're

909
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,440
adding and i'm changing some stuff about

910
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,960
the way it's printed

911
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,360
to make the process more

912
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,399
manageable yeah i'll say but i'll talk

913
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,520
about that later on

914
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,080
yeah but yeah so you can get them now

915
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,960
cortexmerch.com

916
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,480
if you want a journal get a journal

917
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,679
right now

918
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,279
like i remember how hard it was to get

919
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,200
them printed the first time and i'm

920
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,960
basically restarting the process

921
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,200
yeah look like you know we all we all

922
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,720
know like oh look cortex journal is

923
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,080
going through a chip transition

924
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,240
you know so should i get the next one or

925
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,799
should i get the now one get the now one

926
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,039
look at that

927
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,000
like i'm telling you that right now man

928
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,440
you want a journal

929
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,760
you better buy it right now you are

930
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,240
using one and coming towards the end of

931
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,559
it

932
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,480
or if you think you might be interested

933
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,919
you should buy one of these

934
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,640
because i there will be more hopefully

935
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,760
this year

936
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,159
but like who the knows yeah

937
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,760
yeah it's difficult to deal with yeah

938
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,799
yeah we're working on it but

939
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,520
you know it's it is uh

940
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,720
it's hard to make promises it's hard to

941
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,640
have estimates

942
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,960
considering the amount of these that we

943
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,640
have sold and

944
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,880
the amount of times that we've had them

945
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,159
for sale it would seem like

946
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,440
maybe this is like a a little thing that

947
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,880
we work on like

948
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,240
i'm not kidding i spend time every

949
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,679
single day

950
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,520
on this project right every day i'm

951
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,039
doing something on this project

952
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,320
yeah it is this is a very hard business

953
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,799
to run

954
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,640
yeah i mean we we said a year ago like

955
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,559
oh you can totally understand now how

956
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,799
anybody who manufactures a physical

957
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,840
product it takes so much longer than you

958
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,600
than you think and

959
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,279
this is this has been a real lesson in

960
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,840
that of you think oh

961
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,559
why can't they just make another it's

962
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,399
like oh no

963
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,080
no when you when you start talking about

964
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,760
supply chains and

965
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,200
factories and all that sometimes it's

966
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,559
not as easy as just you

967
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,240
wanting to do it yeah but like you know

968
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,039
the basically the work that i'm putting

969
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,120
in now

970
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,559
is from having spent a lot of time

971
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,279
learning over the last

972
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,360
year and a bit right and so i feel like

973
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,880
i'm in so much of a better place now

974
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,399
than i was a year ago

975
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
in trying to understand how to make this

976
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,399
stuff work and

977
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,799
i feel like i'm taking what i've learned

978
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,240
and putting it into this second edition

979
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,200
but the plan being of making this a more

980
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,840
sustainable isn't the word but like a a

981
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,399
running

982
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,159
constantly running yeah product which it

983
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,919
hasn't been yeah the way i described it

984
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,440
is you're trying to smooth out the

985
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,399
variance right

986
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,080
like we don't want big shipments

987
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,880
occasionally like we want to be able to

988
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
figure out how to

989
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,480
how to make this more of a regular thing

990
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,720
that's that's the thing if somebody goes

991
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,519
to cortexmunch.com on july

992
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,000
29th to buy a journal i just want there

993
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,799
to be

994
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,080
one for them it's a simple thing that's

995
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,960
the plan because then

996
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,240
like once we finally get that done i can

997
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,240
turn my attention to

998
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,519
other projects that i've wanted to work

999
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,320
on for two years

1000
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,600
right that are related to the cortex

1001
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,840
brand company

1002
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,200
but the entire output of the cortex

1003
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,159
brand company

1004
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,360
is just soaked up by the consistent

1005
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:21,039
journal

1006
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:24,480
one day so anyway cortex merch.com

1007
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,240
so i have been on a bit of a quest with

1008
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,559
real-time collaboration

1009
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,000
okay so i've had my mind has been taken

1010
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,840
up by note taking

1011
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,760
but i noticed that you'd put something

1012
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,760
in our document about note taking

1013
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,919
as well oh okay you know

1014
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,440
listeners i've just been through a big

1015
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,960
thing like we're recording

1016
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,720
i guess it's a little more than two

1017
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,159
weeks after i put up that whole like

1018
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,399
cgp gray was wrong video where i i was

1019
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,679
partly like reevaluating my entire

1020
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,000
process of working

1021
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,039
yeah it if i can give it a one sentence

1022
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,720
summary

1023
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,960
let's just say there was an error in the

1024
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,960
research process of a video

1025
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,000
and then you made what i think is a very

1026
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,720
good video

1027
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,120
about your process which people can find

1028
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,320
in the

1029
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,679
show notes i'll put a link to it they

1030
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,799
haven't seen already so it was yeah it's

1031
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,000
just it's been like

1032
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,519
it's been quite a two weeks is what it's

1033
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,440
been it's three weeks now actually

1034
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:20,640
and so as as part of like the internal

1035
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,480
post-mortem of that project it's it's

1036
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,440
funny i realized at one point like so i

1037
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,399
basically um like i took a week off of

1038
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,960
all

1039
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,080
writing projects i decided okay after

1040
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,360
this

1041
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,880
what i can't do is i can't just

1042
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,399
you know oh that well that was an

1043
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,840
interesting terrible experience

1044
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,360
like let me just dive right into

1045
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,720
whatever the next video was going to be

1046
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,880
i thought like okay now i need to i need

1047
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,440
to take some time off here

1048
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,919
and now that the correction has been

1049
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,919
made

1050
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,039
and like all of that has been done i

1051
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,039
need to like just

1052
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,399
sort of think about the actual process

1053
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,480
what it's going to look like going

1054
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,360
forward or be able to

1055
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,399
think without a time constraint on like

1056
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,840
what might i want to

1057
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,240
change or you know how might things be

1058
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,519
different and it was funny at some point

1059
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,079
i realized

1060
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,520
oh i'm doing the thing that i think

1061
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,599
people think i spend

1062
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,440
all of my time doing which is thinking

1063
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,760
about productivity

1064
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,599
right like and trying new apps and

1065
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,280
systems yeah and trying new apps and

1066
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,280
systems and it's just like it just

1067
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,800
struck me like three days into the

1068
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,280
project that's a really funny thing

1069
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,800
this is the phenomenon this is a long

1070
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,919
i'm going a long way around here right

1071
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,320
to make a point no no

1072
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,000
this is like the phenomenon that people

1073
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,320
talk about that causes like

1074
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,520
fomo with instagram influencers what do

1075
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,280
you mean where

1076
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,760
you as a consumer only see

1077
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,200
what they show you right so like what an

1078
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,440
influencer shows you so

1079
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,280
it looks like they're traveling all the

1080
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,639
time because they just show you that

1081
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,960
they're traveling all the time

1082
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,879
yeah well for me and you with with

1083
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,960
productivity tools

1084
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,320
we always tell the core texans with

1085
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,079
every tool that we use

1086
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,480
yeah but that doesn't mean all we do is

1087
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,400
try new tools right so like every time

1088
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,839
we do it we tell you about it so it

1089
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,800
feels like we do it a lot

1090
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,079
yeah yeah it's a it is a very funny

1091
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,240
selection effect

1092
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:17,599
that i mean it's it's easily got to be

1093
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,599
99 of the things that i ever try or

1094
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,720
think about relating to productivity

1095
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:26,640
are discussed on the show right

1096
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,480
but i'm not spending 99 of all time

1097
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,800
yeah it's just it's just funny and i

1098
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,240
think this is also unlike the influencer

1099
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,359
effect which is it's just a pure

1100
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,960
selection effect

1101
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,720
i also just think like the you know the

1102
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,560
topic of work

1103
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,920
is always endlessly interesting to me

1104
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,520
like i always when i meet new people i

1105
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,520
do always love to ask them like you know

1106
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,320
oh how do you work and how does it go

1107
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,280
because people are just so wildly

1108
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,400
different

1109
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,599
like one big slider that people end on

1110
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,920
different parts of is the like

1111
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,440
how much do you need scaffolding to

1112
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,079
assist you with your work

1113
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,280
versus how much are you like nike and

1114
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,280
you can just do it

1115
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,800
right and i think that there's often

1116
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,680
like a lot of

1117
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,440
confusion between those two groups like

1118
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,040
not understanding each other

1119
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,520
and so i think the people who are more

1120
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,720
on the just do it end of the spectrum

1121
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,560
then get like doubly frustrated with

1122
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,839
this person talks about productivity all

1123
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,280
the time

1124
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,599
you know and it's just like there's

1125
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,240
there's like an additional layer here

1126
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,240
on top of the selection effect but it

1127
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,880
also just like really made me smile when

1128
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,680
the thought

1129
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,440
popped into my head i was like oh here i

1130
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,520
am i'm reading a bunch of stuff

1131
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,960
on uh particularly note-taking was what

1132
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,560
was my main focus

1133
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,119
but i was like i just i just realized

1134
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,520
like i am the the picture right now

1135
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,599
of what people think i am i'm like i've

1136
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,000
got two ipads in front of me

1137
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,079
i'm taking like notes on one of those

1138
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,160
ipads i've got a whole bunch of index

1139
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,720
cards spread across my kitchen table and

1140
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,880
there's like

1141
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,839
pens and it's like it was just a funny

1142
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,240
moment to become like self-aware like oh

1143
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,520
this is the thing you were like gray

1144
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,240
prime

1145
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,480
yeah exactly it was it's like i'm the

1146
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,320
idea in people's heads of what i am it's

1147
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,880
just like okay this is silly but yeah i

1148
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,920
have to say

1149
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,680
like it was a really interesting i'm

1150
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,520
sort of coming to the end of that time

1151
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,040
now and booting back up the writing

1152
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,880
projects i'm not a hundred percent

1153
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,480
settled on it so this is still a little

1154
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,280
bit of like thoughts and progress on a

1155
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,200
thing

1156
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,560
but one of the areas that i just sort of

1157
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,160
recognized as like what

1158
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,520
really needs rethinking

1159
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,440
is how do i take

1160
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,720
notes right like so when i'm working on

1161
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,760
a project

1162
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,880
how do i organize the information

1163
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,640
related to that project right you know

1164
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,079
and this is we've always talked about it

1165
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,599
the section of the show

1166
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,880
with the best show art of any of them

1167
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,920
ever core right is for years i've used

1168
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,680
evernote

1169
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:59,200
as the the place that is like

1170
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,720
all of my notes and so for all topics

1171
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,839
anything that i think is interesting

1172
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,480
like i just

1173
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,320
save web pages and pdfs and books and

1174
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,920
like everything goes into evernote and

1175
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,920
like all of it is

1176
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,119
tagged with what is vaguely the topic

1177
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,400
that it's related to

1178
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,680
and i've just like i realized i've never

1179
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,320
really thought about that system since i

1180
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,920
first

1181
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,359
started doing it you know nine years ago

1182
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,160
or whatever i've just never

1183
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,839
mentally reevaluated it what do you mean

1184
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
i mean we've spoken about you wanting to

1185
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,480
leave

1186
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,000
evernote a bunch of times okay so no so

1187
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,920
so here here's what i mean by like

1188
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,839
not re-evaluating it so people are like

1189
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,320
hey have you heard the good news about

1190
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,160
microsoft onenote i don't know if you've

1191
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,760
ever heard of a thing called devon think

1192
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,119
but this exists you know like

1193
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,440
that's a totally different sort of

1194
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,680
question of are you frustrated with

1195
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,359
evernote are there problems with the app

1196
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,760
that you don't like that kind of thing

1197
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,680
ah so that was always more the

1198
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,720
application not being suited to the

1199
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,640
process

1200
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,880
yeah but what you weren't considering

1201
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,359
was the process like

1202
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,680
how do i save a piece of information

1203
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,079
where is it stored how is it tagged

1204
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,520
what are these pieces of information

1205
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,720
yeah it's it's

1206
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,480
it's actually it's a little tricky to

1207
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,359
even articulate but but i guess what i

1208
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,800
what i would say

1209
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,920
is this is like on all of my projects

1210
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,560
i would just have a huge

1211
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,400
pile of like here's all the primary

1212
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,960
sources related to whatever this

1213
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,320
topic is you know so and i would i would

1214
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,599
work through those things and like i

1215
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,280
would write a script

1216
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,359
based on them but um

1217
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,280
so okay so here let me back up and talk

1218
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,240
about like

1219
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,599
the story of of like grey's history with

1220
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,400
the concept of

1221
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,400
notes right and taking notes right so

1222
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,280
i've always thought that like the way

1223
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,119
people think about notes

1224
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,599
in particularly like a school situation

1225
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,000
is that notes are totally worthless has

1226
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,640
has always been my experience like

1227
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,359
i don't understand why this happens i

1228
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,839
have a

1229
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,040
i have a particularly weird situation

1230
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,680
with this because

1231
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,240
i literally never took notes in school

1232
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,800
because

1233
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,680
as we found out later i was not able to

1234
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,359
read the board

1235
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,400
for some reason i snuck through the

1236
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,280
entire eye testing system and it was

1237
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,760
never noticed

1238
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,119
until i was well into high school that

1239
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,839
my vision was not good enough to

1240
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,800
actually

1241
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,040
see the board and so i always had the

1242
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,440
experience of

1243
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,800
yeah you sit in school and you know you

1244
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,880
listen to the teacher

1245
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,119
and then you know you take the test

1246
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,400
based on like what you can remember or

1247
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,079
what's in the textbook

1248
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,599
what did you think the board was for

1249
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,720
then

1250
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,359
okay that's an excellent question mike

1251
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,839
uh i don't want to get off on like an

1252
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,160
entire side tangent of this yeah

1253
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,240
but i have in the past year really

1254
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,880
become increasingly fascinated with this

1255
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,079
concept

1256
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,160
of how people cannot notice

1257
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,240
the things in life that they don't

1258
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,720
notice right or like how brains can be

1259
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,720
different

1260
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,200
and you're just completely unaware of

1261
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,079
something and so

1262
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,079
what did i think the board was for is a

1263
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,119
fantastic question

1264
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,880
and like the best answer i can give

1265
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,040
is i guess i thought that this was like

1266
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,480
the teacher was working out things for

1267
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,240
themselves like you know

1268
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,839
when you're doing a math problem you

1269
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,400
have to write it down

1270
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,040
it's their own reference material yeah

1271
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,040
like it was

1272
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,240
like the board was for the teacher i

1273
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,920
guess you know

1274
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,200
um but but i think the like the deeper

1275
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,800
truth of it was

1276
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,440
because i didn't i couldn't see the

1277
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,760
board i just didn't consider it

1278
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,720
right like it just wasn't really in my

1279
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,280
world

1280
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,200
and this also happened to be a perfect

1281
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,280
storm of things because

1282
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,200
um the way the the new york state

1283
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,880
education system works

1284
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,640
is that everything is based around a

1285
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,839
series of like extremely

1286
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,160
automated standardized tests you know

1287
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,920
like

1288
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,520
everything is multiple choice even

1289
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,319
physics tests like they're all multiple

1290
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,280
choice

1291
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:07,040
as much as can be humanly automated is

1292
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,839
and so as a student you have a

1293
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,440
really clear target there are these

1294
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,760
standardized tests

1295
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,319
there's like books about how to pass

1296
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,200
them all of the classes are are oriented

1297
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,240
towards that

1298
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,720
there's very little human subjectivity

1299
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,000
and so the effect of like the

1300
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,400
particularities of

1301
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,520
individual teachers was greatly lessened

1302
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,760
under that system

1303
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,200
right which also means that like it

1304
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,800
doesn't matter so much

1305
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,800
if you're just preparing for the english

1306
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,920
regents exam or the math regents exam

1307
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,280
like that's just a thing that you can do

1308
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,880
and no one cares

1309
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,880
none of the teachers cared about your

1310
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,880
notebooks because like that was entirely

1311
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,319
like hey kid this is your problem

1312
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,160
all we care about is how well you're

1313
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,720
doing on our like practice

1314
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,640
standardized tests so that's also how

1315
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,920
like how on earth did i get through this

1316
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,319
without being noticed

1317
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,560
and also it like i guess there's also an

1318
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:00,160
elements of like random chance in it

1319
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:03,520
because you had to always

1320
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,160
be in every class far enough away from

1321
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,480
the board

1322
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,079
that you could never read it okay so i

1323
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,400
have the answer to this question

1324
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,599
which is that at least in my high school

1325
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,160
you were always allowed to pick your

1326
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,240
seats

1327
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,000
yeah that first day of class it was

1328
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,440
always my goal to sit in the back corner

1329
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,200
right one of the two back corners was

1330
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,640
like that is my prime target and then as

1331
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,079
close as i can get to that is what i was

1332
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,319
always aiming for okay

1333
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,160
so so there wasn't the random chance of

1334
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,599
like oh i'm in the front in some classes

1335
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,839
i was never in the front

1336
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,880
it's like you sit in the front one day

1337
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,720
and it's like

1338
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,119
ah like all the formulations start

1339
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,040
passing in front of your eyes

1340
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,720
what is this incredible source of

1341
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,560
information

1342
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,000
well well again like i just think

1343
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,200
there's a way in which it's just not

1344
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,040
obvious to you

1345
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,880
if you don't know sure the other thing

1346
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,079
for me was like i didn't know you could

1347
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,280
see people's

1348
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,880
faces right across the street so it like

1349
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,880
it never occurred to me that humans can

1350
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,800
identify other humans by their face

1351
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,560
at greater distances yeah when i got

1352
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,319
glasses for the first time

1353
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,800
i kind of equated it like going from

1354
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,400
standard definition to high definition

1355
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,920
right like there were just signs that i

1356
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,960
didn't read and i just figured you

1357
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,800
couldn't read them

1358
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,640
until you've got a little bit closer

1359
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,319
right exactly yeah my vision is not as

1360
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,000
bad as yours clearly but

1361
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,440
but like it's you know i can i can

1362
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,280
understand that a little bit but

1363
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,040
there is just this i mean it's kind of

1364
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,599
hilarious really that like

1365
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,280
just like what bored

1366
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,200
what are you talking about yeah it just

1367
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,880
didn't exist in my world and

1368
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:34,000
i think this is like just one of of

1369
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,839
several kinds of examples where

1370
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,040
like you have no reason to notice a

1371
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,480
deficiency

1372
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,400
my like other example of this is

1373
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,440
colorblindness you know like

1374
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,000
for people who are colorblind once you

1375
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,520
have like a set of tests this is a very

1376
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,240
easy thing to identify

1377
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,920
but people can go a long time without

1378
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,040
knowing that they're colorblind because

1379
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,839
it's just like

1380
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,760
how does this concept enter your mind if

1381
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,240
if it's not like

1382
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,359
brought out in an a b testing kind of

1383
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,359
situation

1384
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,200
you can just think like oh other people

1385
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,480
are better at distinguishing these two

1386
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,240
things but like it just doesn't really

1387
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,800
cross your mind right like why why would

1388
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,920
it

1389
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,560
but yeah so in high school i was like oh

1390
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,079
notes serve no purpose and even after i

1391
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,319
got my glasses

1392
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,240
you know i didn't like start taking

1393
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,119
notes then i just thought like oh

1394
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,359
you know look at all the stuff the

1395
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,720
teacher's writing on the board how

1396
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,400
academically interesting

1397
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,839
is that but you know like i don't i'm

1398
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,640
not gonna start this now

1399
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,119
yeah and then when i went into college

1400
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,280
as a

1401
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:36,000
general statement like all of my physics

1402
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,599
professors provided class notes

1403
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,079
because their their whole thing was like

1404
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,640
hey what we're doing here is really hard

1405
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,079
pay attention and think it through like

1406
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,359
don't waste your time

1407
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:50,400
writing notes in class and so

1408
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,640
that ended up being like my first formal

1409
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,560
exposure to notes was like

1410
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,400
don't bother like we're gonna give you

1411
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,680
notes you know you're grown up now we

1412
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,960
don't have to we don't have to like do

1413
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,680
this pretend game

1414
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,960
when i became a teacher myself i

1415
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,920
attempted to replicate

1416
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,240
creating class notes for my students and

1417
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,000
then

1418
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,760
i was immediately told by the school

1419
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,520
like you can't just give

1420
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,760
you can't just give notes to your

1421
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,280
students in the uk system it's

1422
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,440
incredibly important

1423
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,599
that all of the students are like little

1424
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,560
tiny mimeograph machines like they have

1425
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,560
to write down

1426
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,240
all of all of the things that you say in

1427
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,560
class word for word

1428
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,520
and so my experience as a teacher was

1429
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,599
like

1430
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,880
this whole note system is fraudulent i

1431
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,839
have to make

1432
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,440
kids write down notes so that the school

1433
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,760
doesn't fire me

1434
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,200
because the school cares about when the

1435
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,200
inspectors come

1436
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,200
we have a bunch of notebooks to

1437
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,680
demonstrate that learning has occurred

1438
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,880
to the inspectors because obviously like

1439
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,359
no one can learn anything if you haven't

1440
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,720
had like written documentation of of

1441
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:56,079
that having occurred

1442
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:59,359
so this is this like funny way of saying

1443
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,680
that like i have an entire lifetime of

1444
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,640
academic experience

1445
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,720
that told me taking notes is a kind of

1446
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,280
nonsensical busy work

1447
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,000
and whenever like looking at

1448
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,160
productivity

1449
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,440
materials like reading books or watching

1450
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,040
videos about like how people are

1451
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,079
productive

1452
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,480
i was always really puzzled at

1453
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,520
the parts where people are like oh uh i

1454
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,000
read a book

1455
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,920
and i take these you know these detailed

1456
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,400
notes on like what the book was or like

1457
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,200
what are the important ideas

1458
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,520
and i i like i just always found that

1459
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,640
odd like i don't understand what this is

1460
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,160
and i thought it was a kind of

1461
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,760
i don't know like a kind of cargo

1462
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,440
culting like oh this is a this is a

1463
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,880
thing that you learned in school about

1464
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,559
how people learn

1465
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,079
you know but you're learning when you

1466
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,920
read the book and

1467
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,599
then you remember the things that are in

1468
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,079
the book like the you know these notes

1469
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,839
aren't

1470
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,280
doing anything except they're like uh

1471
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,920
just a repeated behavior

1472
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,480
so all of this brings to like oh what

1473
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,920
was i doing when i'm making videos

1474
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,720
and the answer is like oh i'm reading

1475
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,800
tons of stuff and i'm remembering things

1476
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,960
and the key skill is like

1477
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,640
be able to remember where the

1478
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,359
information that you need

1479
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,119
is like you can just like okay yeah i

1480
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,880
read this thing in this article like let

1481
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,079
me go back and and check where that was

1482
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,200
or like i'd read through books and i'd

1483
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,359
do highlights

1484
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,720
and then i would import those highlights

1485
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,480
and surrounding information into

1486
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,640
evernote and it's like okay great

1487
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,920
now i've got a version of this book that

1488
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,760
instead of having to

1489
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,760
reread 300 pages i've pulled out like

1490
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,200
here are the 20 key pages that are

1491
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,000
related to whatever it is that i'm

1492
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,839
working on

1493
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,079
so there's a way in which like i can

1494
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,160
re-read this book in minutes

1495
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,520
like not reread this book over the

1496
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,839
course of days

1497
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,880
right so like this is kind of what

1498
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,319
evernote

1499
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,520
was to me it was a really big pile

1500
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:55,359
of mostly primary sources with

1501
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,680
occasionally really brief in quotes

1502
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,880
notes at the top of these primary

1503
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,119
sources

1504
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,040
which would be me just like very briefly

1505
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,559
perhaps summarizing like oh what was the

1506
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,559
important thing in this one or like

1507
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,680
this is the one that talks about that

1508
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,119
piece of information

1509
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,280
like that's what that's what evernote

1510
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,359
was for me does that make sense

1511
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,599
yeah i mean i will say i don't think

1512
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,359
that when you're saying like the like

1513
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,720
notes part like it's not no it's like

1514
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,040
that's not taking of

1515
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,640
of sources right like that if i was

1516
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,119
doing what you were doing that's what i

1517
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,760
would do

1518
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,960
right okay but so i almost wish we were

1519
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,559
recording this episode like

1520
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,079
two weeks from now because i think i

1521
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,880
could articulate some of this stuff

1522
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,680
better well that's what follow-up's for

1523
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,559
yeah

1524
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,280
but i think one of the key concepts i've

1525
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,280
had here

1526
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,079
is is like oh partly even writing little

1527
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,359
summaries

1528
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:48,480
to yourself is like not whatever note

1529
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:51,599
is for evernote really

1530
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,119
should be like a library of primary

1531
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,240
sources

1532
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,280
only there is a useful

1533
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,319
layer of what we can call notes

1534
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,839
that can exist on top of this

1535
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,440
and like and that's what i've been

1536
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:09,680
exploring this past week

1537
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:12,800
is okay let me try to get out of my head

1538
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,480
all of this like academic craft that has

1539
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,520
built up in my head about like

1540
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,839
what notes are and try to re

1541
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,720
like re-approach this topic so this

1542
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,240
would be

1543
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,400
yeah because i'm trying to follow here

1544
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,359
the idea here is instead of

1545
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,839
attaching all of the notes to sources

1546
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,480
you

1547
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,599
have notes about certain projects

1548
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,960
certain topics

1549
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,520
certain things and if needed to you can

1550
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,280
say like

1551
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,040
oh i got it from here and then later

1552
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,800
then you can go back to evernote and you

1553
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,000
can find the source if you need it is

1554
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,680
that right

1555
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,280
yeah that's partly what i'm talking

1556
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,599
about you know because because again

1557
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,359
like

1558
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,359
one of the things where it's like why do

1559
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,960
i think notes were sort of weird like i

1560
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,319
very rarely would make what people call

1561
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,599
like

1562
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:58,000
margin notes in books because

1563
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,240
it it always seemed to me like i don't

1564
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,440
know just it just seemed sort of

1565
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,040
pointless like i don't i don't

1566
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,160
understand what it is and i do think

1567
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,160
that there is something

1568
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,079
pointless about them kind of hides the

1569
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,839
information yeah so this is this is

1570
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,119
exactly it like it strikes me as a sort

1571
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,400
of busy work of like

1572
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:18,240
if you're writing this note

1573
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,480
shouldn't that note be in the project

1574
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,480
that you're working on because otherwise

1575
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,280
like how are you ever going to access

1576
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,680
that again

1577
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,720
you have to read the book again exactly

1578
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,400
so this is where like

1579
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:33,440
my script my like quote script document

1580
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,319
often started with lots of

1581
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,079
like what would be margin notes in some

1582
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,440
sense like just kind of got thrown into

1583
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,480
the script document is like okay well

1584
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,160
this is the place where they go because

1585
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,960
i actually need to work with them

1586
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,400
so like i guess what i'll say is like

1587
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,400
one of the one of the places where i

1588
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,040
found useful information

1589
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,160
to start and that got me kind of like

1590
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,760
thinking about it

1591
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,119
in the right way is i almost hesitate to

1592
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,240
mention it because you know again like

1593
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,800
we have

1594
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,400
there's like the notion nation nation

1595
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,160
represent there's the rome

1596
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,359
heads like there's there's all these

1597
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,920
different there's all these different

1598
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,319
like

1599
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,680
groups rovers the roams roam rovers or

1600
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,040
enthusiasts yeah something like that

1601
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,559
there's a better one in there somewhere

1602
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,160
we can come up with yeah somewhere

1603
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,599
somewhere it is yeah rome riders like

1604
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,200
you let us know what it is

1605
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,680
what about romanticists

1606
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,040
that's that's terrible okay i rate that

1607
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,720
zero out of a thousand that's awesome

1608
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,000
all right i mean come on you could have

1609
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,000
just gone 10.

1610
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,160
i i don't know maybe the romanticist's

1611
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,520
really like that kind of terrible pun

1612
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,520
you just used it it's not canon

1613

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,640
popular genre and figuring things out

1663
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,319
and so anyway like while wandering

1664
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,440
around the internet

1665
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:16,880
i found another like really

1666
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,480
really niche like sub-community of this

1667
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,400
kind of thing

1668
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,040
which i'm going to call the zettle

1669
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,240
zealots what is that

1670
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,839
so i came across this note-taking system

1671
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:33,359
which is called zettelkaston and

1672
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:38,000
i i refuse i refuse

1673
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:40,640
uh yeah z-e-t-t-l-e k-a-s-t-e-n

1674
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,599
zettle casten settle constant is this

1675
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,280
german yeah

1676
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:47,920
it is german uh and and some of the

1677
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,920
some of the zettel zealots will insist

1678
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,599
that you should say it in german like

1679
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,200
so it should be to settle and it's like

1680
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,480
no like

1681
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:59,839
hard like i have this for vedina um it's

1682
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,839
like because of her her surname nyantsu

1683
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,599
yeah that that ts sound yeah she would

1684
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:06,640
say to me it's it's the

1685
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,359
sound in pizza right so it's zeddle

1686
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,040
custom

1687
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,040
i guess something like that and now

1688
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,599
every german just laughed at me but

1689
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,040
yeah yeah i know the sound like yeah i

1690
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,480
have the same thing with dutch where

1691
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,079
like there's sounds that i can hear in

1692
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,200
it and like i can identify that sound

1693
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,799
but i just i cannot

1694
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,240
reproduce it properly so anyway i'm

1695
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:24,880
going to say zettle casted and

1696
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,240
and there's like this community of like

1697
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,079
zettle zealots but there's

1698
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,599
there's some interesting stuff in here

1699
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,160
and like i don't want to get into the

1700
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,720
whole thing

1701
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,640
is this an app i can't it doesn't look

1702
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,920
like it's an app oh mike you're going to

1703
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,480
make me get into the whole thing no

1704
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,359
it's a system right it's a system right

1705
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,200
it's a system

1706
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,559
and the best way i can i can sort of

1707
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,280
explain it is like

1708
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,079
like with anything i'm not really

1709
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,680
interested

1710
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:52,079
in the system itself it's like oh

1711
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,040
there there was a person who invented

1712
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,640
the system and

1713
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,000
he wrote a million books because of it

1714
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,480
and it's like okay great like all that

1715
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,040
lore

1716
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,960
whatever like i'm just here i'm here as

1717
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,119
like a value vampire to just

1718
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,799
extract whatever happens to be useful to

1719
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,799
me from this system of yours

1720
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:10,480
right and one of the key concepts that

1721
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:14,000
i've come across which just like

1722
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,720
it was never clear in my mind was this

1723
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,640
distinction between

1724
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,160
sources and notes and so this is this is

1725
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,240
what i'm getting at with like

1726
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,839
with evernote it's like the moment

1727
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,200
you're writing anything

1728
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:31,920
in in evernote like that's the wrong

1729
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,640
place for it evernote is where primary

1730
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,720
sources

1731
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:39,200
exist and your script

1732
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,480
is is the place where like the script is

1733
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,760
the project

1734
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,760
that you know that should be like the

1735
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,799
words that you're going to record into a

1736
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,920
microphone to turn

1737
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:51,040
into a video but there does additionally

1738
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:54,079
exist a category of useful writing

1739
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:57,359
which we can call notes and

1740
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,640
the one of the valuable ideas that i've

1741
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:02,480
extracted

1742
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,920
from the zettlecaston system is

1743
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,559
it just fits in perfectly with stuff

1744
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,079
that i've done before of like okay

1745
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,440
you're thinking of notes like when you

1746
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,359
were in school and you're supposed to

1747
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,200
have like a three-ring binder

1748
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,400
that tells you everything you ever

1749
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,079
wanted to never know

1750
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,400
about the english civil war right or

1751
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:21,520
whatever it's like no forget that

1752
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,599
instead what you want are like

1753
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,280
index cards think of it in a physical

1754
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,240
way you've got a whole bunch of index

1755
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,520
cards

1756
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,480
and each index card is a note and each

1757
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,000
note

1758
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:37,200
should be a single idea

1759
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,200
about this topic or it should be a

1760
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,160
single summary of a primary source that

1761
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,280
exists

1762
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,559
elsewhere and these are your notes on

1763
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,799
the topic

1764
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,480
and coming across this i felt like oh

1765
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:53,680
this is a huge relief

1766
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,559
because it felt like two things one it

1767
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,520
reminded me

1768
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,720
of forever ago coming across getting

1769
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,960
things done

1770
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:04,079
where it was really important for

1771
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:07,040
someone to create this distinction of

1772
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,240
you have to do lists but there's two

1773
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,200
things here there's

1774
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:13,520
projects and there's actions and like a

1775
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,799
lot of your problem around to-do lists

1776
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,960
is that you're not drawing this

1777
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:20,160
distinction in your mind

1778
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:24,079
and i think like i'd never had this just

1779
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:27,200
pointed out in a clear way of like

1780
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:31,359
primary sources and notes

1781
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:34,480
and that notes exist as like

1782
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:36,240
atomic individual ideas

1783
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,000
you're not trying to like recreate a

1784
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,680
whole book with your notes

1785
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,920
you're trying to have like a stack of

1786
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,559
index cards with information about this

1787
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,960
topic

1788
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,720
that you can look at and like this has

1789
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,960
been incredibly helpful

1790
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,200
and it was also like oh this is perfect

1791
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,880
because i realize like quite naturally

1792
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:57,520
this is a thing that i've sort of done

1793
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,480
many times when i'm stuck with a project

1794
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,960
which is okay

1795
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,119
stop looking at it on your computer you

1796
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,359
know write out some of the basic ideas

1797
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,440
on

1798
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:07,119
index cards and like put them on a table

1799
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,799
in front of you and sort of think about

1800
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,319
it for a while and like

1801
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:13,040
you know as we've discussed many times

1802
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:14,240
being able to work with paper is often

1803
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,079
quite clarifying

1804
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,839
when you're having problems in a digital

1805
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,599
system i think i'm struggling to

1806
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:22,240
understand a little bit yes plea

1807
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,960
here's the thing please ask questions

1808
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,799
because

1809
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,559
it's also helpful to me at this point to

1810
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,280
clarify because like a lot of this stuff

1811
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,839
is still not

1812
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,720
perfectly settled in my mind but i feel

1813
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:34,160
like i'm on

1814
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,640
the right track with a really

1815
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,079
important re-evaluation of how the

1816
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,079
system works going

1817
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,599
forward that i haven't reevaluated in

1818
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,040
like a long time in this way

1819
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,520
all right so i have two things i want to

1820
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,200
do one is i think i've found a summary

1821
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,799
of the method on wikipedia but i'll

1822
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,079
leave that for a minute yeah no

1823
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,000
right i'll leave that for a minute

1824
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,200
because i might not need to get to this

1825
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,520
we're gonna tell you right now

1826
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,599
don't read anything about it it won't

1827
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,040
help you right so then i'm trying to

1828
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,280
understand then

1829
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,839
what this new system is for you and why

1830
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,280
zettle custom is involved at all

1831
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,119
because all right let's say you've read

1832
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,880
a research paper

1833
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,119
and there are things in that research

1834
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,960
paper that you want to remember

1835
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,480
they're like notes that you want to take

1836
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,559
right where do they

1837
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,000
go don't worry about the app or whatever

1838
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,240
but like do you have a

1839
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,520
separate place right now that you'll put

1840
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,319
quotes and thoughts

1841
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,599
in uh okay so so yeah right now since

1842
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,599
i'm i'm still

1843
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,200
i'm still in the playing around with it

1844
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,799
phase but let's talk about the idea in

1845
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,160
the abstract right

1846
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,319
so as you're reading through some

1847
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,079
primary source when something that's

1848
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:39,920
interesting comes along

1849
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:42,720
one of the ideas is like okay by hand

1850
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,920
write a summary of that on a little

1851
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,400
index card

1852
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,960
and so it's like okay liberty island got

1853
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,640
bigger

1854
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,760
over time it's like oh okay well that's

1855
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,280
interesting like that's an interesting

1856
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,640
piece of information so like

1857
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,920
liberty island uh is three times larger

1858
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,760
than it was 200 years ago is like a note

1859
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,040
on this topic

1860
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,960
and that can just live on an index card

1861
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,240
because this is like the smallest

1862
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,799
condensation of us

1863
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,000
of a single idea and so it's like okay

1864
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,079
that just goes

1865
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,079
and as you keep reading through sources

1866
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,640
it's like oh there was a supreme court

1867
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,839
case

1868
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,680
in 1800 about this dispute

1869
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,119
okay so then you go and you read that

1870
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,640
supreme court case

1871
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,480
you find out like some piece of

1872
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,920
information and again like you'll write

1873
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,040
down a discrete

1874
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,640
fact on on this it's like uh no

1875
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:33,040
documentation exists for

1876
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,240
why the island got bigger like i don't

1877
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,680
mean into

1878
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,119
to be like this is like how i studied

1879
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,640
history

1880
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,640
right which was just like i had a

1881
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,319
notebook and what i did was write down

1882
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,640
facts figures and tiny pieces of

1883
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:48,079
information when i was in school so i

1884
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,760
could pass the test

1885
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,839
right and i say that as in such a way as

1886
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,130
like i don't want to make fun of you not

1887
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:55,280
being able to see the board

1888
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:58,240
[Laughter]

1889
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,359
no no like i mean man like don't don't

1890
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,520
get me wrong like this

1891
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,920
this is a that's why this is like such a

1892
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,559
weird topic for me because it's like

1893
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,920
and it's also just been it's why i

1894
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,760
mentioned at the beginning like

1895
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,200
how can you not notice a thing that

1896
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,480
you're missing right

1897
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,160
yeah is is it really is like

1898
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,599
every time you know you ever watch i'd

1899
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,000
ever watch a video and someone's like

1900
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,160
here's

1901
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,440
here's how i use uh you know rome and

1902
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,559
i'm gonna take a bunch of notes on a

1903
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,000
thing i was like

1904
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,799
what are you even doing like i don't

1905
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,799
understand why you feel the need to

1906
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,200
write all this stuff over again this is

1907
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:32,640
so

1908
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,200
fascinating to me this is fascinating

1909
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,520
i can't get my head around how someone

1910
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,319
who does what you do

1911
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,440
didn't really do this i guess you were

1912
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,119
more like

1913
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,960
highlighting things right because you

1914
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,520
always talk about the highlights and

1915
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,200
of the kinder books right yeah so hi

1916
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,440
like highlighting in kindle books

1917
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,880
and importing books into kindle like

1918
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,319
this this is also one of the reasons why

1919
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,520
i was always like i cannot possibly

1920
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:58,240
leave evernote

1921
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,839
because right because of like the

1922
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,400
highlights and the ability to import

1923
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,720
books this is

1924
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,839
incredible like the scales are falling

1925
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,160
from my eyes

1926
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,960
right now i get it way more like it

1927
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,240
wasn't just

1928
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,760
uh it always felt to me and i'm sure now

1929
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,640
this is why people would always say like

1930
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,039
why you should

1931
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,000
do one though what's wrong with you it's

1932
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:19,559
not it wasn't

1933
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,559
the system it was the actual like

1934
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:23,680
application the data was there what else

1935
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,319
were you gonna do

1936
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,799
like you couldn't move because you

1937
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:30,079
weren't

1938
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:32,400
moving notes you were moving massive

1939
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,119
pieces of information that had notes in

1940
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,079
them

1941
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,640
yeah which were more like underlines of

1942
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,440
stuff

1943
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,760
rather than you seeing a thing and being

1944
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,839
like

1945
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,799
i'll write that one down yeah and and

1946
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:46,079
and again like

1947
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:47,359
the the thing it's it's it's so again

1948
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,119
it's like there's just this way in which

1949
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:50,000
i've never really thought about what i

1950
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,440
was doing

1951
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,680
but part of the reason why over the

1952
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:57,039
years i've talked about highlights

1953
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,000
is because of this of this key thing of

1954
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,880
like i need to be

1955
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,480
able to highlight the important things

1956
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,440
because when i come back to whatever

1957
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,200
this is

1958
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,119
i need to be able to reread this entire

1959
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,640
book in 20 minutes right and that like

1960
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,920
and that's what i need to be able to do

1961
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,240
and that's what everything that's

1962
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,440
like the wrong that's like the wrong

1963
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,599
thing what you needed

1964
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,359
oh i just got to go to the notes on this

1965
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,920
subject i don't need to go back to the

1966
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,440
book

1967
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,039
the the other thing that i would say is

1968
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,240
like

1969
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:28,240
what i was working with

1970
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:30,079
is a memory of primary sources like

1971
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,440
whenever i'm working on any project it's

1972
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,079
like okay yeah i've got a folder in

1973
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,280
evernote

1974
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,799
you know which is like oh here's all the

1975
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,839
primary sources about whatever this

1976
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:38,160
topic is

1977
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,839
but i'm also able to remember very well

1978
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,359
like oh i read this thing in that thing

1979
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,799
like let me go back and just double

1980
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,359
check whatever these numbers are right

1981
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,920
but this

1982
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:47,119
is this is one of those four systems

1983
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,920
because

1984
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,480
you are relying on your memory oh i know

1985
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,119
right like

1986
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,079
everything you need to because if you're

1987
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,480
having to

1988
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,319
remember where to go to find the

1989
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,359
information

1990
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,920
the system's wrong yeah because you what

1991
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:04,880
you need

1992
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,039
is just the one place that all the

1993
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,319
information is on one topic rather than

1994
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:12,319
here's a folder of 20 research papers

1995
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,760
all i have to do is remember which

1996
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,520
research paper to go to

1997
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,119
right yeah yeah and and it's it's also a

1998
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,559
way in which like

1999
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,400
it's just very interesting like you see

2000
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,920
how you work and i've just

2001
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,359
never thought about it and i've been

2002
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,000
doing this for years and just kind of

2003
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:27,119
build it up

2004
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,359
i cannot believe it's taken us six years

2005
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,359
nearly to get to this

2006
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:33,119
like because this is like when you know

2007
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:34,240
obviously a big thing but like i'm sure

2008
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,720
you can see how like

2009
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:38,400
it's fundamental right like this is this

2010
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,559
part of your system

2011
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,480
whether it's the old way or the new ways

2012
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,839
is like a fundamental part of the way

2013
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,119
that your research is done

2014
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:48,000
and just for some reason we have never

2015
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,640
understood

2016
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,400
with each other that this was a thing

2017
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,039
right like i had always just taken as

2018
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,359
read

2019
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,520
what you were doing mm-hmm and it never

2020
01:05:55,359 --> 01:06:00,720
really thought that you didn't like

2021
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:03,039
it's like for me right i would have a no

2022
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,760
let's imagine that i was making a video

2023
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,920
about

2024
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,160
the history of nintendo i would have a

2025
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,880
note that was like

2026
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,720
the history of nintendo and in that note

2027
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,920
would have subheadings with like here's

2028
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,839
something about the nes

2029
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,079
here's something about the snes and like

2030
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:19,920
all of the little pieces of information

2031
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,760
that i would find out from watching

2032
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,039
videos reading articles and i would just

2033
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,799
bring them in

2034
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,039
that's my system but if i was working on

2035
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:29,680
your system my assumption would be i

2036
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:33,680
would save all of that stuff to a place

2037
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:35,839
and make inline notes in separate places

2038
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,880
about those sources so if i was reading

2039
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:39,039
an article

2040
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,880
i would make notes on the article or if

2041
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,640
i was reading a video maybe like

2042
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,160
notes in a comment like in the video

2043
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,119
maybe i'd save a link to it in evernote

2044
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,640
or whatever

2045
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,559
but then when it comes for me to then

2046
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,920
write the script i have to be like all

2047
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,520
right so now i need to go back

2048
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,599
oh i know there was something in the nes

2049
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,960
and this one and this one

2050
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,880
but in the system that i always have had

2051
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,640
all of the nes stuff would be in one

2052
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,119
place right like i feel like it

2053
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,839
if i if i'm following correctly that's

2054
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,760
kind of like

2055
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:07,039
the difference because you were saying

2056
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,880
about taking a

2057
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,440
quote-unquote index card and putting a

2058
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,440
piece of information on it right

2059
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,440
what are these index cards in a digital

2060
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,799
system well okay so here's

2061
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,319
here's also part of the reason why i

2062
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,839
like like what are people doing with

2063
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:22,079
these notes i don't understand

2064
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,599
is because even when you start talking

2065
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,559
about like oh i'm gonna let me i'm gonna

2066
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,520
write an outline

2067
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,960
you know we're talking about here's an

2068
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,480
a4 piece of paper it's gonna be filled

2069
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,319
with information about nintendo

2070
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,480
you know oh they were founded in what is

2071
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:33,039
it so it's like 1897 or something it's

2072
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,039
great they were

2073
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,079
playing card company in 1897 you know

2074
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,000
whatever

2075
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,839
that kind of stuff that always feels to

2076
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,480
me like why aren't you just writing a

2077
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,160
script

2078
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,280
if you're doing this like what is what

2079
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,839
is this thing that you're even doing

2080
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,839
here

2081
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:47,119
or the reverse of it is what is this

2082
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,799
ridiculous outline like

2083
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,640
you know you might put a timeline like

2084
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,160
have a list of dates on a piece of paper

2085
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,359
with just the basic information about

2086
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,520
what happened when

2087
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,400
all of this extra stuff is superfluous

2088
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,559
because

2089
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,839
you can just like quickly reread the

2090
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,599
book on nintendo

2091
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:03,119
and like revisit the primary source and

2092
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,720
like make sure that you have everything

2093
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:09,760
correct like that's very time intensive

2094
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:11,760
i i think it's it's less so when

2095
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,520
you realize like again why were some of

2096
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,839
the features of evernote

2097
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,759
really key important to me and like one

2098
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,560
of them is when you're highlighting pdf

2099
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,799
documents

2100
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,239
evernote has an amazing feature which

2101
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,159
even in a pdf will like

2102
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:26,080
pull all of those highlights right to

2103
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:28,080
the front well and also as well i assume

2104
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,679
the ocr is very helpful yeah

2105
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,359
the ocr is incredibly helpful yeah for

2106
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,759
sure because if you are

2107
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,839
thinking to yourself oh i need every

2108
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:37,440
piece of information about this part i

2109
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,880
know i've read it in some articles you

2110
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:42,480
could just search for it

2111
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,839
yeah yeah it's just very interesting and

2112
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,759
having made these videos and have

2113
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:47,440
experts look them over like i have

2114
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,120
a really great track record of the

2115
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,080
experts being like yeah this script is

2116
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,600
totally fine

2117
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,880
you're right it's like a great system

2118
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,400
works you know like there's no there's

2119
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,120
no indication of like

2120
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,640
you need any change with this yeah but

2121
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,600
anyway so like just just thinking about

2122
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,600
all of this like

2123
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,440
so one of the key things about the

2124
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:07,520
zettel castin which really

2125
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:09,040
resonates with me is i totally just i

2126
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,199
hate the concept of like

2127
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,279
notes on a single piece of paper it's

2128
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,400
also why like the app that i use for

2129
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:17,279
writing my scripts

2130
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,120
is ulysses because one of the key

2131
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,799
features of ulysses is they're like no

2132
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,640
no we don't have a piece of paper that

2133
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:24,239
you're writing a script on

2134
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,920
you know they they call them sheets i

2135
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:26,480
think but it's it's the same thing where

2136
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,120
it's like

2137
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,799
pages can be arbitrarily long they can

2138
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,239
break at any point

2139
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,400
you know they can have page breaks i

2140
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:36,960
mean and you can have little

2141
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,799
sections right and so you can move the

2142
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,799
little sections around all the time

2143
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,880
and i'm fairly sure that like no one

2144
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:46,159
uses ulysses the way i do

2145
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:48,960
where borderline you know every

2146
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:50,719
paragraph or two is broken up as a

2147
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,799
completely different little section

2148
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,360
because i'm very often like rearranging

2149
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:56,400
these things so this is why the concept

2150
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,480
of like

2151
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,960
you want to be able to move the notes

2152
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,040
around is really helpful to me

2153
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,640
because very quickly in a project it

2154
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,320
becomes super clear like

2155
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,840
oh i don't care about this part but if

2156
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,360
i've like written it on a piece of paper

2157
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,600
or it's like a heading on an

2158
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,040
outline it's sort of like stuck in place

2159
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,960
and you have to deal with it

2160
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,640
right whereas you know if i'm working on

2161
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,199
who owns the statue of liberty

2162
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,000
and what i have is a is like a stack of

2163
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:23,280
oh here's

2164
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,719
40 index cards of like your notes on

2165
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,280
this topic

2166
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:28,960
there's a way in which like you can sort

2167
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,480
them or arrange them in such a way that

2168
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,600
it makes more sense like okay these

2169
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,840
relate to each other

2170
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,120
right this i don't care about at all and

2171
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,600
i can like move this around

2172
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,040
but when you're saying note right like

2173
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,159
this is this is the nomenclature i

2174
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,159
really want to make sure i'm getting

2175
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:45,600
correct you mean like

2176
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:47,520
a singular piece of information

2177
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,960
yes right because i think a lot of

2178
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,560
people including me

2179
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,239
think of a note as this page

2180
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,239
yeah so this is kind of why like when i

2181
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:57,679
was looking around and reading stuff

2182
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:59,440
like i immediately

2183
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,920
sort of gravitated towards settle

2184
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,520
casting because this is one of the key

2185
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,800
concepts like they talk about

2186
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:09,520
notes as being atomic right so it's like

2187
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,280
each note is an atomic piece of

2188
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,520
information you shouldn't be able to

2189
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,960
reduce it can i read from wikipedia now

2190
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,800
please let me read from wikipedia i

2191
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,600
think it will help i genuinely okay go

2192
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,920
ahead go ahead

2193
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,239
a zettel casten consists of many

2194
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,920
individual notes with ideas and other

2195
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:26,159
short pieces of information

2196
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,199
that are taken down as they occur or are

2197
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,600
required

2198
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:31,600
the notes are numbered hierarchically so

2199
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,120
that new notes may be inserted at the

2200
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,520
appropriate place and contain

2201
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,520
metadata to allow the note taker to

2202
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,920
associate the notes of each other

2203
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,000
for example notes may contain tags that

2204
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,080
describe key aspects of the note

2205
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,080
and they may reference other notes the

2206
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48,000
numbering metadata format structure of

2207
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,520
the notes is subject to variation

2208
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,440
depending on the specific method

2209
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,280
employed i think that helps

2210
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,560
because it's the idea at least i think

2211
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,520
i'm following is that the reason this

2212
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,920
system seemed to

2213
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,760
meet with you is that you've got like

2214
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,239
little pieces of information

2215
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,040
and they're put into a system but they

2216
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:06,480
are

2217
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:09,920
free to be moved around yes

2218
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:13,280
but they are in like a hierarchy or they

2219
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:16,000
are associated with each other but

2220
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,280
not in such a way of like here is an

2221
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,080
outline

2222
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,040
yeah right okay yeah like one one of the

2223
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,199
key things

2224
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,640
you know and this again is where like my

2225
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,080
feelings about notes and outlines so i

2226
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,920
was like this seems like nonsense

2227
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,360
before you write a paper create an

2228
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,960
outline of the paper like what are you

2229
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,800
going to write in each of these sections

2230
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,560
there's like that is a bunch of nonsense

2231
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,000
that's saying before you write the paper

2232
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,159
you need to know what the paper is about

2233
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,679
it's like well uh how am i supposed to

2234
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,239
do that before i write it you know it's

2235
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,880
like

2236
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:44,800
the outline's the hard part apple like

2237
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,320
it's this is not the easy part to get

2238
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,760
you started like it's

2239
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,000
you know i always found that stuff just

2240
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,560
really frustrating and again is is why

2241
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,320
with so many of like the way this stuff

2242
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,400
is taught in school it just seemed to me

2243
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,480
like what what is this charade everyone

2244
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,480
is playing like i don't understand oh

2245
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,480
i can write an outline before i know all

2246
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,239
the things about the topic exactly how

2247
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,400
am i supposed to do that

2248
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:08,480
this is also why like this system of

2249
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:11,840
like little notes that are just

2250
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:13,360
individual pieces of information means

2251
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,960
it doesn't matter what order you come

2252
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,520
across these pieces of information

2253
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,600
right you know like writing and research

2254
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:23,920
are non-linear processes

2255
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:26,159
and by having individual atomic notes

2256
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,239
they can be created and found in any

2257
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:31,120
order it doesn't matter

2258
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:33,040
one of the other things that i don't

2259
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,400
know if this is going to be helpful but

2260
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,400
since i'm still in this intermediate

2261
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,360
stage but i suspect it's going to be

2262
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,600
helpful

2263
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:46,800
is i have a strong feeling that

2264
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:50,159
this will help also more clearly define

2265
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:53,199
when am i writing versus when am i

2266
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:54,320
researching right now in the video

2267
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:57,120
creation process

2268
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,120
and for always like those two phases

2269
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:02,080
have been very difficult

2270
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,880
to even distinguish from each other

2271
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,880
quite often

2272
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,960
and so i suspect like i'll be able to

2273
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,400
draw a greater distinction between those

2274
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,560
two and that might be

2275
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,520
useful like even in my own time tracking

2276
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,080
system

2277
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,199
in theory i've always had two timers one

2278
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,600
which is called like

2279
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:19,440
writing and one which is called research

2280
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,560
but i'm very aware that i treat those

2281
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,159
two as totally

2282
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,679
indistinguishable from each other like

2283
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,320
very often i'm starting the research

2284
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,880
timer and

2285
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:28,000
it's like yo i've basically spent all

2286
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,920
this time writing or

2287
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,159
or vice versa and it's like who cares

2288
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:35,040
it's this is all the same sort of

2289
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,960
non-linear deeply interconnected process

2290
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,120
it's not like when you write you no

2291
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,960
longer refer to the material

2292
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,400
yeah so yeah and again like on my

2293
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,000
computer screen like this is also why

2294
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,960
like whenever i'm writing

2295
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,880
i would almost always have evernote open

2296
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,800
on the side and it's like oh yeah

2297
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,480
here's that report that dude wrote about

2298
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,760
tumbleweeds 100 years ago like i want to

2299
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,440
have that on screen while i'm

2300
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,040
writing the section about tumbleweeds

2301
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,960
you know that kind of thing but it also

2302
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,880
does make it like a bit more burdensome

2303
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,800
that i'm always like 100

2304
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,640
looking at the primary sources right

2305
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,760
when really what you need is

2306
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:10,080
this group of atomic notes

2307
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,320
yeah and then you can pick out the ones

2308
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,480
that are most necessary for the current

2309
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,400
part of the script that you're writing

2310
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,840
yeah it's it's like a layer of

2311
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,480
information that exists

2312
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,199
between the script and the primary

2313
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,640
sources

2314
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:25,920
whereas i'm totally aware that i keep

2315
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,840
describing

2316
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,760
i mean i'm sorry listeners i'm sure this

2317
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,360
must be infuriating as i explained to

2318
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,040
you like what you learned in grade

2319
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,800
school is a useful skill right

2320
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:40,560
it's like yes it is this is very surreal

2321
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:42,480
um to be talking about like because it's

2322
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,080
but it's i guess it's kind of

2323
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:48,000
fascinating because it's

2324
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:50,840
like how would you

2325
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
rediscover this type of note-taking

2326
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,440
today

2327
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,800
so okay so this new gray system

2328
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:01,040
does it only include text

2329
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,000
uh what do you mean well like if you had

2330
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,960
an image

2331
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,719
oh yeah so again since i'm just playing

2332
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,040
around and it's still very fluid

2333
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,320
i've been largely working on actual

2334
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,840
paper because i think that's always the

2335
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,960
best way to think about something

2336
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,360
yeah but i have found one of these apps

2337
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,040
to do this kind of thing and it's an app

2338
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,640
called obsidian

2339
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,000
it's funny it's actually someone's uh

2340
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,760
it's a very small team and it's their

2341
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,120
quarantine project like it's it's a

2342
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:29,120
thing that they've been working on

2343
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:32,080
so it's it's still pretty early

2344
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,040
what was that sound this looks

2345
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,640
complicated

2346
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,400
okay so the reason this caught my

2347
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,440
attention and is also

2348
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:42,000
uh it supports latex

2349
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,840
okay right okay okay like let me let me

2350
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,640
get there mike

2351
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,600
you've been found out so this is like a

2352
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,440
note app

2353
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,600
and i would say this is very much in the

2354
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,760
like notion rome

2355
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,719
family you know this is this is another

2356
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,560
version of like

2357
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,840
different people are trying to approach

2358
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,199
this sort of concept

2359
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:03,440
of these interconnected webs of

2360
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,800
information this looks so complicated

2361
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,199
yeah but here's here's the thing a thing

2362
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,040
finally clicked for me which was

2363
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,960
you know last time we were talking about

2364
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,480
how like oh i was working in notion and

2365
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,199
i was just trying to type and

2366
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,960
slash or and then like when i hit slash

2367
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,360
a whole world of opportunities opened up

2368
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,040
to me

2369
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,440
it's like oh my god i don't i don't need

2370
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,280
to insert a a kanban board in the middle

2371
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,400
of this sentence but thanks guys that's

2372
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,080
right

2373
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,239
i think for all also reasons which may

2374
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,320
be much more clear now i'd also

2375
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:31,840
largely just totally dismissed the very

2376
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,040
notion of apps like notion

2377
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,280
and rome i was like this is just

2378
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,199
nonsense this is just academic busy work

2379
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,040
for people who don't really need it

2380
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,640
so it just just so happens like working

2381
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,159
with obsidian and just playing around

2382
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,640
with it and seeing like okay what's the

2383
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,640
deal

2384
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,640
you know of all of these various notes

2385
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,199
like the zettle heads seem to really

2386
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,960
like

2387
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:50,239
this this one in particular so i was

2388
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,280
like oh let me play around with it and

2389
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:54,239
the thing

2390
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:55,120
finally clicked in my head which is i

2391
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:58,880
realized

2392
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:03,120
oh okay what all of these note

2393
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,760
systems are doing is very similar to the

2394
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,280
thing

2395
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:10,480
that i used to use in college which was

2396
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:13,920
org mode on emacs and it's it's the same

2397
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:17,040
concept of like when you're typing

2398
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,080
at any point you can link to something

2399
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:21,280
else or insert

2400
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,280
different kinds of information and

2401
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,640
something about like the graphical user

2402
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,040
interface of a thing like

2403
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,080
notion made makes it to me feel like

2404
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,120
really cumbersome

2405
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,960
and absurd but when i think about it as

2406
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:35,600
yeah but you can do this whole thing

2407
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:38,159
just with in an extremely large number

2408
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,400
of text files on your computer

2409
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:42,159
there's a way in which like oh it feels

2410
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,920
much more simple to me

2411
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:46,159
and i realized like yes when i used to

2412
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,679
use org mode on emacs like that's what

2413
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:49,600
this thing was you can like

2414
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:51,199
link to any other text file or you can

2415
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,280
quickly include some to do's

2416
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:55,520
you can include your latex formatting if

2417
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:59,120
you want to you can insert a calendar

2418
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:01,840
but it's all done via text files and

2419
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,239
that's the thing that obsidian is doing

2420
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,800
it's

2421
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,920
similar to rome it's similar to notion

2422
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,400
the key difference

2423
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,520
is that they're just doing it entirely

2424
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:12,640
through markdown

2425
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:15,040
files on your local drive

2426
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,320
and it's like oh okay cool i get it i've

2427
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,960
been

2428
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,760
using markdown to write my scripts for

2429
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,159
forever

2430
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,239
so this is like no burden whatsoever to

2431
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,920
then also do a bunch of notes and mark

2432
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,920
down and it means that like

2433
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,520
the transition between those two is

2434
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,679
ridiculously simple if i want

2435
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:35,679
information to go one way or the other

2436
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:38,480
but so this is like a digital version

2437
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,080
of doing the index cards and this is

2438
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,679
where like oh yeah if you have an image

2439
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,560
that you want to use like you can

2440
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,320
include it

2441
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,320
in just the way markdown formats

2442
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,880
including images but ultimately it's all

2443
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:50,400
just

2444
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:51,840
here's 300 you know dot md files on your

2445
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,480
on your hard drive they're just text

2446
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,159
files and if you type double brackets

2447
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,840
you can link from one to another which

2448
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,760
is like the exact same thing that rome

2449
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,440
does like if you're typing in rome

2450
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,520
you can open up two double brackets and

2451
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:05,600
you can link to any other one of the

2452
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,360
notes anywhere in your in your system

2453
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,880
so does that answer your question of

2454
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,480
what happens if you have a picture

2455
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,880
uh kind of i'm really lost looking at

2456
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,360
this

2457
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,320
obsidian app i would not recommend

2458
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,639
obsidian

2459
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:20,880
for you mike no because i don't really

2460
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:24,400
understand

2461
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,360
like so you're creating where are you

2462
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,120
making notes

2463
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,639
well again for me i'm still doing this

2464
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,159
almost entirely with paper as i'm

2465
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:33,840
figuring out what's useful okay

2466
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:36,239
right i have played around with obsidian

2467
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,239
um but again like just like we talk

2468
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:41,199
about when people are figuring out their

2469
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:42,960
to-do systems like you don't want to

2470
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:44,480
prematurely optimize

2471
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,000
for the digital version because you're

2472
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,360
going to get too distracted by the

2473
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,360
features or lack of features

2474
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,040
of whatever digital tool it's the same

2475
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,520
thing here like i just wanted to play

2476
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:55,760
around with obsidian to see like

2477
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,760
let me understand the concept of what

2478
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,880
this is in a digital form

2479
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,920
which is you can have virtual index

2480
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,480
cards with

2481
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:06,000
virtual strings connecting related ones

2482
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:08,800
together it's like okay

2483
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,480
cool i understand that and that also

2484
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,800
helped me understand

2485
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,840
this is very much like you know i mean

2486
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,840
the reason i think you're feeling

2487
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:18,320
overwhelmed looking at it is it's

2488
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,920
very linuxy which is what made me think

2489
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:22,239
like oh yeah this is just like

2490
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,840
org mode from a thousand years ago you

2491
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,719
know so you can have this digital

2492
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,960
version but

2493
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,320
it's just like the basic idea is for any

2494
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,400
project

2495
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,400
you can have notes that are just

2496
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:34,560
individual pieces of information

2497
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:37,040
those pieces of information because

2498
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,880
they're on index cards

2499
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:41,440
are not constrained by your

2500
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:44,239
preconception

2501
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:46,880
of either like what is the hierarchy or

2502
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:49,199
what is the order of these notes

2503
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,719
that can that can come out of it later

2504
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:52,800
when you realize

2505
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,639
oh these three pieces of information are

2506
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,760
related or like these two pieces of

2507
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,199
information i thought they were

2508
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,639
interesting and important at the start

2509
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,239
but it turns out that they're actually

2510
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:01,520
irrelevant so i can put them at the back

2511
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:06,239
of the list

2512
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:09,679
it's really just about the reordering

2513
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:12,320
layer and again i think

2514
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,280
why this feels like it's a useful step

2515
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,639
for me

2516
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:17,360
is because it's it feels like this

2517
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:21,440
pre-script

2518
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:23,360
layer where it's much easier to

2519
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:25,520
think about some of the information

2520
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:29,440
related to a topic

2521
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:30,239
without one reviewing the primary

2522
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:33,280
sources

2523
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:36,719
even in their much compressed form or

2524
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:39,440
two writing the script where

2525
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,239
there's also this additional layer of

2526
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,480
what is the

2527
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:43,600
style in which i'm saying this

2528
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,920
information

2529
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,080
right because the script is not just a

2530
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,920
recitation of facts right no one would

2531
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,280
watch the videos if i was just like here

2532
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,719
let me tell you all the facts about the

2533
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,600
situation

2534
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,239
that has a whole other like what is the

2535
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,239
style

2536
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,840
how is this being told like what are the

2537
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,199
visuals going to be like that's an

2538
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,159
additional thing that i have to think

2539
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:07,560
about when doing that so the notes layer

2540
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:11,040
feels like information

2541
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:14,080
organization without the burden

2542
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:17,199
of style and without

2543
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:19,760
the weight of the primary source

2544
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:20,560
right that's that's the way i think this

2545
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,800
will

2546
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:28,560
work going forward i feel like

2547
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,239
rome is a good option for you from what

2548
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,560
i know about it

2549
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:33,280
okay why do you say that because it is

2550
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,800
all about

2551
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:39,280
like singular pieces of information that

2552
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:42,320
can very easily link together

2553
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:45,760
and from what i know of

2554
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:48,880
rome it is available

2555
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,880
on the web on all devices and

2556
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,320
my understanding is they are making apps

2557
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,679
for all platforms

2558
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,159
my concern would be with an app like

2559
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:58,080
obsidian is like mac only

2560
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:59,440
which i don't know if if that's the

2561
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:02,480
right

2562
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:05,760
method oh yeah 100 100 like

2563
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:07,840
no ios app for obsidian is the hugest

2564
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,840
downside yeah you know 100 but again

2565
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,880
this is why like i'm not really invested

2566
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,120
in

2567
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,639
what is the digital tool at this stage

2568
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,679
yeah i want to come back to that though

2569
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:18,000
like i really do

2570
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:20,080
but yeah yeah but like the thing is i

2571
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,840
wanted to just play around with it

2572
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,239
because there is a way in which it can

2573
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,280
be briefly clarifying about like what do

2574
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,480
people mean when they're talking about

2575
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:29,199
linking notes okay

2576
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:31,280
i think that you had to start looking at

2577
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:32,159
some of these things like notion rome

2578
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,120
obsidian

2579
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:35,679
for you to be able to clarify the the

2580
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,400
basic

2581
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,760
system yeah right like i can see that of

2582
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,880
like all right you're like all right

2583
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:45,360
okay so i'm not wild here it is a a

2584
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,159
valid like way that people collect

2585
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,239
information

2586
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:49,920
right yeah and now you can go back to

2587
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:53,440
doing what you what you're doing now

2588
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,320
of like making sure that this basic

2589
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:59,840
structure

2590
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:59,840
makes sense to you this has been a trip

2591
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:05,010
wow well you know you think you know

2592
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,760
someone

2593
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:09,520
[Laughter]

2594
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,280
well i mean again this is where i really

2595
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,440
i really mean this thing of

2596
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,880
of like my other drumbeat from being

2597
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,080
just a person who makes things on the

2598
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,960
internet is

2599
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,920
the deep deep realization that human

2600
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,480
communication

2601
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,040
is much harder than people think it is

2602
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,080
yeah

2603
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:27,840
and one of the reasons is that human

2604
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,840
brains are much more different than

2605
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:33,040
people think they are

2606
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:36,400
but they're also different

2607
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:37,600
in extremely subtle and hard to notice

2608
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,600
ways

2609
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,960
and this can be one of these sorts of

2610
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,960
things where it's just like

2611
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,560
something that seems obvious to everyone

2612
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,880
can be non-obvious for

2613
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,560
someone else or just because the way

2614
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,159
like one person's brain

2615
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,920
works like a thing that works for

2616
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:53,600
everyone doesn't work for them

2617
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:56,639
well like we have been talking about

2618
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:59,920
notes apps for so many years but

2619
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:02,560
never had we realized that we were doing

2620
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,280
this process in such vastly different

2621
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,520
ways

2622
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,199
yeah yeah it casts back on the like

2623
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,719
every time you're talking about evernote

2624
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:10,239
or note-taking apps like you realize

2625
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,639
like oh there's something else

2626
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:14,400
here right that makes this conversation

2627
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:18,159
make a lot more sense

2628
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:20,320
which is gray thinks notes are like a

2629
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:23,199
potemkin village of knowledge that

2630
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:24,000
schools require students create for

2631
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:26,239
inspectors

2632
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,920
and have no intrinsic value whatsoever

2633
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:30,000
and grown-ups who make notes

2634
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,840
are just repeating the behaviors from

2635
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,639
their childhood without understanding

2636
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,639
why they're doing it

2637
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:39,280
right just because you couldn't see the

2638
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,960
board

2639
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:43,199
i still like i do still wonder like how

2640
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,239
on earth i made it so long without being

2641
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:46,239
able to see the board

2642
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:48,080
oh realize it like that's the funny part

2643
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:49,600
to me right like it never came up

2644
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,840
it just never came up i do wonder

2645
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,159
sometimes because i think

2646
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,840
perhaps if i'm trying to recreate like

2647
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:57,040
how did this situation even begin in the

2648
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,639
first place

2649
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,159
i do know like one of the most important

2650
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:02,000
gifts that my parents ever

2651
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:03,760
gave to me was when i was in middle

2652
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,080
school they gave me

2653
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,840
this like course on how to memorize

2654
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,120
stuff and i know we've talked about this

2655
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,800
sometimes

2656
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:13,040
and like i remember in middle school

2657
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:16,159
just really devouring

2658
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:17,280
this set of tricks of how to remember

2659
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:19,840
things

2660
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,719
and i've always just been aware of how

2661
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,760
that

2662
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:26,159
one thing got me through high school

2663
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,280
and college is like here's how to

2664
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:28,960
memorize things

2665
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:31,440
and so i also just wonder is like is

2666
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:34,000
that a contributing factor

2667
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,719
to how i was able to get by with no one

2668
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,960
noticing

2669
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:38,960
i couldn't read the board is because i

2670
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,239
was like oh yeah no i've got this hack

2671
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,000
for the school system

2672
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:43,170
that just lets me pass these

2673
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,199
standardized tests

2674
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:47,120

2737
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:39,040
so do you remember last time we were

2738
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,040
talking about real-time collaboration

2739
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,239
applications you were looking for

2740
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,760
alternatives to

2741
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,679
google docs that's what you were doing

2742
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,600
yeah because we were upset about no dark

2743
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,280
mode and then i said to you all right

2744
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,320
let's try out word look out for an

2745
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:52,000
invitation from me

2746
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,679
oh yeah and well i haven't opened my

2747
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,760
email since then but i assume that that

2748
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,679
invitation never came it never got sent

2749
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:00,400
okay because word didn't pass

2750
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:01,280
the initial testing for me okay

2751
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,600
basically i

2752
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:05,199
spent a couple of days trying out lots

2753
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,239
of different applications you know like

2754
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:09,679
i tried

2755
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:11,760
word i tried pages i tried

2756
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:13,679
like notion for something like this i

2757
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,440
tried apple notes

2758
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:17,120
effectively the problem is none of them

2759
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:19,280
are as instant as google docs

2760
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:21,199
and you know like i was just doing some

2761
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:24,000
simple testing with like i would have

2762
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:27,120
word open on my ipad and word open

2763
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,080
on my mac in the mac app or

2764
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,480
in the web browser and the issue would

2765
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,960
be

2766
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,080
that it would update the information but

2767
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,560
not immediately

2768
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:38,400
it would kind of like you could

2769
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:40,239
basically watch the system do it like

2770
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,960
you would start typing a bunch of stuff

2771
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:44,320
you would stop you would see like saving

2772
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,920
and then a couple of seconds later it

2773
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:48,400
would appear in the other place

2774
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,199
right and like that is not what i want

2775
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,360
and then

2776
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:52,400
so i was doing these tests in between

2777
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,480
the time of like

2778
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,760
us recording and releasing the episode

2779
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,600
and honestly by the time

2780
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,920
we released the episode i realized that

2781
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,600
both word pages and everything else none

2782
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,280
of them were as good as google docs

2783
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,120
then i started hearing from other core

2784
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,000
texans who were like please please don't

2785
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:08,320
use word

2786
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,280
i have lost so much work through their

2787
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,840
collaboration

2788
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,560
system because it's conflict right like

2789
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,000
this

2790
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,239
we were talking about it's like is

2791
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,320
conflict also like you know

2792
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:20,800
there were people that were saying to me

2793
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,520
like oh word has a dark mode as well

2794
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,080
but it doesn't have a dark mode like the

2795
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,960
ui

2796
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,000
goes dark but the page is still white

2797
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,679
and then there were people that would

2798
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
tell me all you have to do is change the

2799
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,679
page

2800
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,360
to a black background and the text to

2801
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:35,280
white no that's not a dark mode

2802
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,960
that's not a dark mode right like that's

2803
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,480
you making changes that you'll

2804
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,639
eventually like

2805
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:42,080
when you're on a system that has light

2806
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:43,520
mode and then it won't make any sense

2807
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,600
because the page is black

2808
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,639
yeah i hate those pseudo-dark modes so

2809
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,719
much

2810
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:50,800
i was really pumped because apple uh

2811
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:52,560
recently released a dark mode

2812
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,560
for numbers their spreadsheet program

2813
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:57,040
that i use so much i was like oh

2814
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,560
finally like dark mode for spreadsheets

2815
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,159
now the spreadsheets are just as white

2816
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,679
as they ever were yeah just so the ui

2817
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:03,760
chrome is dark which just

2818
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,360
that's not you know it's like it's not

2819
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,320
helpful like email apps are fine you

2820
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,159
know like you

2821
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:10,080
it just inverts the text color but it's

2822
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:11,120
not like everybody's getting emails that

2823
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:14,480
are just white text

2824
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:17,120
right yeah because that's no good so

2825
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:18,639
basically there's a long version of this

2826
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:20,880
but i don't think it's worth

2827
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:22,480
necessarily going into at this point the

2828
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,400
short version is

2829
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,000
i've come to conclude that real-time

2830
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:28,000
collaboration for me is more

2831
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,440
important than the native os features

2832
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,920
that i want right

2833
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:33,920
because the most important thing that

2834
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,520
goes into these documents is the text

2835
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,600
and the text has to be correct for

2836
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,920
everyone and if it isn't

2837
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,440
then what was the point in even starting

2838
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:44,159
the document in the first place

2839
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:46,000
like if real-time collaboration was not

2840
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:47,360
as important like if all i wanted was

2841
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,080
just to have like the most native

2842
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,679
features

2843
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,760
i'd probably just use apple notes for

2844
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,440
everything right like that's the

2845
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,960
decision i kind of come to it's like

2846
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,320
that's an application that's always

2847
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,840
going to be up to date with a system it

2848
01:32:56,320 --> 01:33:00,320
has good hooks in the system and i love

2849
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,320
it i use it for so much stuff

2850
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:05,120
but the problem is like you have to wait

2851
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:06,639
for people's stuff to get synced in

2852
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,239
and then the other issue i was finding

2853
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:09,679
is that all of the new

2854
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:11,840
pieces of software that people are

2855
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:14,239
creating like in the vein of a google

2856
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:17,120
docs like a kind of a web-based solution

2857
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:18,800
they want to be everything they want to

2858
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,440
be docs and sheets and chat

2859
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:22,800
and tasks and everything and everything

2860
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,719
and everything and everything

2861
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,440
right and that's also not what i want

2862
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:30,480
like i want a focused product

2863
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:32,320
so i think i'm basically back in the

2864
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,290
place that i end up being once every

2865
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,480
year or two

2866
01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:36,400
[Laughter]

2867
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,520
google docs is the best at what google

2868
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,600
docs does

2869
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,280
yeah and i just have to hope that google

2870
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,600
will update it to be what i want it to

2871
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,239
be

2872
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:46,320
i'm sorry that your your journey into

2873
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:49,360
real-time collaboration apps was

2874
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,000
was less of a less of a march and more

2875
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,920
of just a

2876
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,840
circle right back to where you started

2877
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,159
in like two days

2878
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,760
it really it really didn't at least it

2879
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:59,760
was a short circle then it wasn't

2880
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,600
that's true that's true i could i didn't

2881
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,560
have to do a lot of work to come to this

2882
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,600
decision

2883
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,480
but i just i've come to really rely and

2884
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,520
value

2885
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:13,040
what google docs does

2886
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:14,719
and it's the best of what it does

2887
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,719
fundamentally

2888
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:17,920
so i mentioned that now was a busy time

2889
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,880
for me right like

2890
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,600
a lot going on right now and the big

2891
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,800
project

2892
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:27,840
that i have uh on my horizon is the

2893
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:30,320
podcast-a-thon podcast-a-thon 2. oh

2894

2895
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,920

2896
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:35,120
listeners may remember that last year uh

2897
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:37,040
we raised

2898
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,560
a ton of money it was an incredible

2899
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:40,400
thing for the saint george children's

2900
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,000
cancer research hospital

2901
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:44,719
and i'm going to be talking a little bit

2902
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,040
more about this on our next episode

2903
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:48,960
but we are fundraising again starting

2904
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,400
now and throughout september if you go

2905
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,040
to century.org

2906
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,920
relay you can give money there it would

2907
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,920
be incredible

2908
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,760
uh for you to support the cause we had

2909
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,199
such an incredible showing last year we

2910
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,159
raised over three hundred thousand

2911
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:02,159
dollars

2912
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:04,159
um which was just absolutely

2913
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:06,000
unbelievable blew us all away

2914
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:08,239
and we want to do it again we want to

2915
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,840
raise that money again uh because

2916
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:11,280
you know these it's difficult right

2917
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,080
everything's difficult for everyone

2918
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,760
right now

2919
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,920
but that doesn't mean that this is the

2920
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:17,600
thing that we also can't continue to

2921
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,600
think about and we should

2922
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,639
like saint jude is such an incredible

2923
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,800
place like

2924
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:24,480
they do such incredible work the

2925
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,760
treatments that have been invented at

2926
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,760
saint jude

2927
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,360
they've helped push the child cancer

2928
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,760
survival rate from 20

2929
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:33,520
to more than 80 percent in his 50 years

2930
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:36,639
of being around

2931
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:39,280
and so supporting this charity like

2932
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,760
their mission is to make sure that no

2933
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,719
child

2934
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,760
dies from cancer and i think they can do

2935
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:45,360
that right like

2936
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,600
they've they've done such incredible

2937
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:49,360
things over 50 years

2938
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:52,639
we want to continue to support their

2939
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:55,360
work so if you go to studio.org

2940

2941
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:59,600

2942
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:02,000
a long way to helping this

wonderful institution and the children

2944
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,199
that they

2945
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,920
take care of and this isn't a charity

2946
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:08,000
that is

2947
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,440

like last year we did everything

2973
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,199
in memphis tennessee that at the saint

2974
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,040
ju campus they have these incredible

2975
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:04,800
production facilities there

2976
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:07,440
and i mean i can't be there so

2977
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:09,600
currently at the moment uh big project

2978
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:13,040
is getting mega studio

2979
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,520
set for this event oh right you're going

2980
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,440
to need

2981
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:17,600
filming as well right like this whole

2982
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:21,119
video you want to look good on camera

2983
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:22,320
so i have my one person production crew

2984
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:24,800
of adina right now

2985
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:26,800
and we are making it happen we're

2986
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,639
setting up sets we're getting some

2987
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:32,080
lights we're getting tripods

2988
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:33,119
and yeah there's there's a lot going on

2989
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:35,840
and it's the be

2990
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:36,400
it's a big project for everyone right

2991
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,600
now

2992
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,119
because as well as coming up with the

2993
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,400
content that we want to put into the

2994
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:42,800
event it's like

2995
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,440
just the basics you know when we started

2996
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:46,880
the planning for podcast-a-thon 2

2997
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,639
it was like all right how can we make

2998
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,440
this bigger and better and focus on the

2999
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:51,280
content

3000
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,800
so we started doing that and now we have

3001
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,320
the sub project of

3002
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,000
okay now we need to rework all the

3003
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:58,719
logistics as well so

3004
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,239
right right so it's a bigger project i

3005
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:01,920
mean i'm really pleased this is the

3006
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:03,280
second one we've done because if it was

3007
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:05,360
the first one it would have been

3008
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:07,679
infinitely harder because now we've been

3009
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:09,840
able to learn from last year

3010
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:11,280
and you know like i genuinely think that

3011
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:14,560
the remoteness of it

3012
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:16,159
is not going to affect it the only

3013
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,960
difference is me and stephen are not in

3014
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,800
the same place

3015
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,080
because yeah every guest we had last

3016
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,239
year well

3017
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:23,760
but many of the guests we had last year

3018
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:25,280
were remote guests

3019
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,360
it's really lucky that you were able to

3020
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,000
do it with stephen in person the first

3021
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,679
time

3022
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,600
that makes a huge difference for trying

3023
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:32,080
to do it all remote the second time for

3024
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,960
sure

3025
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:36,239
yeah so we've learnt from it and we have

3026
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:39,119
an incredible team

3027
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:39,600
at st jude and ulsak to help us put it

3028
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:41,760
on

3029
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,280
like they've given us access to lots of

3030
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,440
incredible resources

3031
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,400
so i'm really excited about it but i'm

3032
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,400
also like

3033
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,520
super nervous about it because it's a

3034
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:53,679
it's a big

3035
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:55,760
job like for us to get this studio

3036
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,040
ready for that like it's it was never

3037
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,440
made for that

3038
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:00,480
right so like we're currently setting up

3039
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:03,199
sets

3040
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,800
effectively like locations like fixed

3041
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:06,719
locations in the studio

3042
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,639
wait what do you mean like sets of

3043
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,360
locations like are you gonna transition

3044
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,520
to oh this is

3045
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,560
this is mike by the fireside kind of set

3046
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,280
like pretty much

3047
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:17,679
yes so we're going to have three three

3048
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:20,880
locations in the studio like one

3049
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:23,040
it's like a relaxed location one is a

3050
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:26,239
behind the desk location and one

3051
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:27,119
is a secret location that i won't reveal

3052
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:29,119
just yet

3053
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:31,360
okay because we're setting up something

3054
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:33,280
which is in scope

3055
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:35,840
maybe a little more than we should do

3056
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:37,440
but if we are able to execute it and i

3057
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:40,719
believe that we will

3058
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:43,520
will be incredibly fun so it's a big

3059
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,080
project and like i'm super happy that i

3060
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,920
have

3061
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:47,920
diana's time for this like she's

3062
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,600
basically pushing everything to the side

3063
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,199
to do this because there's no way i

3064
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:53,760
could do this on my own

3065
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:55,760
like even just like getting the basic

3066
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:59,040
equipment that we need

3067
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:00,719
is a huge task because like you try and

3068
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,600
find a good light right now yeah i was

3069
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:03,440
gonna say do you have

3070
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,880
those uh those fancy like i don't know

3071
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,400
what they're called the things that you

3072
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,320
use to bounce the light off of so you

3073
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,600
can look you know really great on yeah

3074
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,920
i don't think i've gone to that level

3075
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,560
what i mean the bounce shields i don't

3076
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,159
know yeah

3077
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,000
shields that's what they call it in the

3078
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:18,480
biz uh you know like

3079
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,119
this stuff like um and it's a great

3080
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,679
product like

3081
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:22,639
the elgato key light all the streamers

3082
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:24,159
use these lights

3083
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:26,000
they're fantastic i've been able to get

3084
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:27,440
a couple of this more of your rgb

3085
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,440
nonsense is that what you're talking

3086
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:31,679
about here it's just a pure

3087
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,040
light there's no rgb on this one but it

3088
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,159
is it's something that all the game

3089
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,520
streamers use

3090
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:39,360
but yeah it's like this is an

3091
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:43,040
interesting task to tackle

3092
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:45,679
because this is not my world

3093
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:47,040
uh so but it's something that we are

3094
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:48,960
getting a handle

3095
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,960
of during the fundraising process

3096
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:52,000
between now and september 18th like

3097
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,520
we're raising money all through

3098
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
september but obviously we want to have

3099
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,800
a like

3100
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,080
a like a lead up to the podcast-a-thon

3101
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,960
like we're going to be doing other

3102
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,600
twitch streams

3103
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,800
and this is all like testing of the

3104
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,679
setups right okay

3105
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,760
so we can make sure that like we have

3106
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:09,360
the basics ready before we have to

3107
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:11,920
commit eight hours you know

3108
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:13,520
right yeah yeah that's not when you want

3109
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,400
to find out how difficult it is to

3110
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,840
switch between

3111
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,840
sets is when you're trying to do

3112
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,320
something live for eight hours exactly

3113
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,920
like because

3114
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:21,679
there's even like one thing where i've

3115
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,520
already realized like oh okay

3116
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,880
i found a great tripod i need two of

3117
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,920
these

3118
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:30,800
right and so like i've got this like car

3119
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,159
we bought from ikea that has like a

3120
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,920
small tripod on it

3121
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:35,199
the laptop that i'm going to be using

3122
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,159
the light and

3123
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:40,080
gear right that i need in if i'm because

3124
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:41,679
then basically we're moving this car

3125
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:43,199
around to the different parts of the

3126
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:45,760
studio right

3127
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:48,159
so it's all in a fixed location but what

3128
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,679
i've learned is for two of the locations

3129
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:51,520
it would be better if i can just pop the

3130
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:53,040
camera off and put it onto a tripod

3131
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,080
which is on the ground rather than on

3132
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:56,239
the car

3133
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:58,719
so like this is the benefit of doing

3134
01:41:56,239 --> 01:42:01,440
these smaller tests

3135
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:02,400
of trying to work out what this

3136
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:04,080
environment

3137
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,840
will be good for and there's like two

3138
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,600
things which is like uh

3139
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,360
benefits one i'm pleased we didn't have

3140
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:11,040
this place entirely furnished because we

3141
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,920
would not have the space to do what we

3142
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,600
want to do

3143
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,199
right right yeah you didn't know that

3144
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:18,719
surprise you need to build

3145
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:21,760
three filming sets in mega studio

3146
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:23,920
and two it's helping us accelerate

3147
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,760
the furnishing process because the stuff

3148
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:29,199
that we need for this

3149
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:33,040
so yeah it's this is a very interesting

3150
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:34,159
task to undertake but i'm very excited

3151
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,840
about it and it's

3152
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:37,360

3153
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,600

looks like you're right mike it's zombie

3242
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,400
time

3243
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:44,239
the only real piece of information that

3244
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,280
we need is what kind of zombies are we

3245
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:48,080
dealing with here

3246
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:49,280
are they like zombie zombies or are they

3247
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:51,920
28 days later

3248
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:54,080
zombies if they're zombie zombies zombie

3249
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:58,400
zombies aren't that big of a problem

3250
01:45:54,080 --> 01:46:00,480
i'm hoping it's zombie zombies

3251
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:02,000
you have a fire extinguisher if we have

3252
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,440
to use this fire extinguisher to

3253
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,280
extinguish a fire i'm going to be very

3254
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:07,280
disappointed

3255
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:09,600
it turns out this is just a lesson in

3256
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:11,520
fire safety this whole adventure

3257
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:13,440
i guess typical style we check this

3258
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,080
floor right like let's not leave the

3259
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,600
floor

3260
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:17,600

3261
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,400
swat team here we're gonna cover our

3262
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,480
corners

3263
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,080
we're gonna take it floor by floor with

3264
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:24,560
a fire extinguisher just like a good

3265
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,560
swap team

3266
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,400
the theater is filled with the shuffling

3267
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,280
bodies of zombified patients and staff

3268
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,679
members

3269
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:34,159
there are too many zombies here to fight

3270
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:36,480
upon seeing you they become agitated

3271
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:37,840
and start to close in get out close the

3272
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:40,239

01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:44,880
zombies begin to enter the kitchen we're

3276
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,320
this round

3277
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,920
we shouldn't have opened that door huh

3278
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,880
the zombies attack you and bite you and

3279
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,679
kill you and you die

3280
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,679
the end all right okay

3281
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:57,920
you open the heavy door and find a chef

3282
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:00,000

me to add vitamin z to the meatloaf

3285
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:06,159

3286
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:10,159
no no i'm gonna turn the dial okay oh

3287
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:12,159

3289
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:16,000
sense of exploration mike

3290

you guys may not remember the past text

3291
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,800

3292
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:23,440
conversation before

3293
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:25,199
set dial to high the machine hums and

3294
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:26,719
the zombie thrashes around

3295
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:28,400
but something goes wrong the machine

3296
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:29,040
starts to smoke and the electrodes catch

3297
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,320
fire

3298
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,480
the zombie's eyes burst from their

3299
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:35,520
